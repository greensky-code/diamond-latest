        <h4 class="calibre1">MEMBR Supplemental Information</h4>

        <p class="doc-level"><a name="MEMBR_About_Privacy_Indicator_SUPP"></a>About
            the Privacy Indicator</p>

        <p class="body-text">Using the member Privacy Indicator, you can indicate
            if a member has prohibited release of his or her member information to
            outside entities. When creating a new member record in MEMBR, the Privacy
            On check box is set automatically with the default value in the PRIVACYIND
            parameter; you may override the default setting. The member’s privacy
            preference is stored in the member’s eligibility record. Once you have
            saved the member record, you may only update the Privacy Indicator using
            the Modify Privacy Indicator function.</p>

        <p class="body-text">When you modify the Privacy Indicator using the Modify
            Privacy Indicator function, DIAMOND:</p>

        <ul class="calibre15">

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-text-block"><p class="bullet-text-block">Terminates
                the current eligibility record</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-text-block"><p class="bullet-text-block">Creates
                a new eligibility record with the updated Privacy Indicator and all data
                from the terminated record</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-text-block"><p class="bullet-text-block">Creates
                a Notes entry of note type PRI recording the change.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p class="doc-level">Verifying Student/Dependent Status</p>

        <p class="body-text">When the <span class="calibre41">Verify Student/Dependent
 Status</span> command is selected from the <span class="calibre41">Special</span>
            menu, the <span class="calibre41">Dependent Verification Status</span>
            dialog box displays, on which a dependent status is entered: S Student,
            H Handicapped, and a verified thru date is entered. DIAMOND checks the
            verified through date during claims processing and issues a warning message
            if the member’s relationship code (the code in the <span class="calibre41">Rel
 Code</span> list in keyword MEMBR) indicates that the member is a child
            (C) or other dependent (O), and the member’s age as of the claim date
            of service is greater than the member’s associated Group Contract (GRUPC)
            record’s "Student Age To" and the primary date of service on
            the claim is greater than the verified through date on the member’s Dependent
            Verification Status record.</p>

        <p class="doc-level"><a name="MEMBR_Notes_on_Benefit_Start_Date_SUPP"></a>Notes
            on Benefit Start Date</p>

        <p class="body-text">By default, DIAMOND determines subscriber/family member
            benefit eligibility (for claims adjudication) and benefit accumulation
            periods based on the associated benefit rules’ time frame and number of
            years/days (see BRULE — Time Frame, No. Years/Days). For benefit rules
            with a time frame of "Contract Yr," <span class="calibre30">DIAMOND</span>
            determines benefit eligibility and benefit accumulation periods based
            on the subscriber’s/family member’s associated group contract effective
            date (see GRUPC — Effective Date).</p>

        <p class="body-text">If you enter a benefit start date in this field, you
            override the <span class="calibre109">DIAMOND</span> default
            and the subscriber’s/family member’s benefit eligibility and benefit accumulation
            periods are based on the subscriber’s/family member’s Benefit Start Date
            (not the GRUPC — Effective Date). To create benefit eligibility and benefit
            accumulation periods based on the entered Benefit Start Date, the subscriber’s/family
            member’s associated benefits rules must have a BRULE — Time Frame of "Contract
            Yr."</p>

        <p class="body-text">The Benefit Start Date usually remains unchanged from
            one eligibility period to the next, unless the subscriber’s group or plan
            changes.</p>

        <p class="body-text">If the member is a subscriber (normally Person Number
            01) with no prior period of eligibility, enter the date from which benefits
            will begin to accumulate. <span class="calibre109">DIAMOND</span>
            automatically updates all existing family member’s eligibility records
            with this Benefit Start Date.</p>

        <p class="body-text">If the member is a subscriber with a prior period of
            eligibility, <span class="calibre109">DIAMOND</span> displays
            the Benefit Start Date from the prior period. Press TAB to accept the
            displayed date or enter a new Benefit Start Date if required as a result
            of a group or plan change.</p>

        <p class="body-text">For all family members other than the subscriber<span class="calibre20">,</span> <span
                class="calibre109">DIAMOND</span>
            displays the subscriber’s Benefit Start Date for the eligibility period.</p>

        <p class="tip-note-warning">Warning</p>

        <p class="numbered-list">1. You can adversely affect benefit accumulation
            when you change a Benefit Start Date. You should only change the Benefit
            Start Date to correct an error or when a subscriber changes groups or
            plans. Remember, when you change a subscriber’s Benefit Start Date, DIAMOND
            automatically updates the Benefit Start Date of all associated family
            members.</p>

        <p class="numbered-list">2. If you are reinstating a subscriber/family
            member(s) who have a Benefit Start Date:</p>

        <ul class="calibre15">

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-text-block"><p class="bullet-text-block">Reinstate
                the subscriber first in MEMBR (Special&gt;Reinstate) and leave the Benefit
                Start Date blank.</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-text-block"><p class="bullet-text-block">Reinstate
                all family members.</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-text-block"><p class="bullet-text-block">After
                all family members are reinstated, return to the subscriber’s MEMBR record
                and enter the Benefit Start Date. DIAMOND automatically updates the Benefit
                Start Date of all associated family members.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p class="body-text">See BRULE Type 00 — Time Frame, Contract Yr. for examples.</p>
