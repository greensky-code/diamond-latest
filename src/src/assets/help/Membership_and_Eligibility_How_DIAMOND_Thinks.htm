            to member records</h2>

        <p class="text">It is critical that changes to member demographic and eligibility
            records be made using the appropriate DIAMOND feature. In most cases,
            changes to eligibility must be made using one of the many commands on
            the menu bar found in MEMBR. DIAMOND does include changes made either
            in MEMBR or MELIG in all processing, including Capitation and Premium
            Billing, but some limitations apply to MELIG changes. </p>

        <p class="text">Specifically, if changes are made in directly in MELIG rather
            than using commands on the <span class="calibre41">Special</span>
            menu in keyword MEMBR the following limitations apply: </p>

        <ul class="calibre1">

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet1"><p class="bullet1">Changes made to a subscriber
                never ripple through to dependents, regardless of the Dependent Edit flag
                on line of business (LINBS).</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet1"><p class="bullet1">Changes are made to DIAMOND‘s
                eligibility file only. Other records containing eligibility information,
                such as authorizations or claims, are not updated.</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet1"><p class="bullet1">Member ID cards are not generated
                automatically as a result of the change.</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet1"><p class="bullet1">Provider changes made using
                MELIG are not validated against DIAMOND’s provider/member enrollment functionality
                (PROVE) records.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text">There are, however, some changes which must be made using
            MELIG:</p>

        <ul class="calibre15">

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet1"><p class="bullet1">Correcting the r desubscriber

                (UserDef 1-3)</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="calibre1"><a
                name="Membership_and_Eligibility_Enforcement_of_subscriber_dependent_eligibility_consistency_MID"></a>Enforcement
            of subscriber/dependent eligibility consistency</h2>

        <p class="text">You may elect to relax the standard edits DIAMOND uses to
            make sure that dependents cannot have eligibility and benefits which are
            outside of or different from the subscribers. In most commercial health
            plans, this consistency is critical. In some situations and programs (e.g.
            Medicaid, often) the eligibility of dependents can be different from that
            of the head of household or subscriber. Therefore, by line of business
            you may choose to eliminate this editing.</p>

        <p class="text">When consistency tests are enforced, Diamond requires that
            <span class="calibre20">all</span> dependents must be enrolled
            in the same group and plan as the subscriber. In addition, the dependents’
            effective and termination dates must fall <span class="calibre20">within</span>
            the eligibility period of the subscriber; i.e., dependents are eligible
            for coverage based on the subscriber’s eligibility dates and the dependents
            will<span class="calibre20"> not</span> be eligible after the
            subscriber is terminated.</p>

        <p class="text">If you choose to relax the edits, consistency tests are <span class="calibre20">not </span>enforced.
            In addition, be aware
            that:</p>

        <ul class="calibre15">

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet1"><p class="bullet1">Premium Billing (GPBIL) <span
                    class="calibre20">cannot</span> be used for this line of business,
                since billing logic assumes that all members of a family are enrolled
                in the <span class="calibre20">same</span> benefit plan and
                that the eligibility periods of the dependents <span class="calibre20">always</span>
                fall within the eligibility period of the subscriber.</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet1"><p class="bullet1">Family unit-oriented benefit
                rules (such a family deductibles) <span class="calibre20">cannot
 </span>be used for this line of business.</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet1"><p class="bullet1">MEMBR &gt; Special &gt; Member
                Address Ripple <span class="calibre20">cannot</span> be used
                for this line of business.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text">To manage which kinds of business require consistency, and
            which do not, use the LINBS record, Dep Edit field.</p>

        <h2 class="calibre1"><a name="Membership_and_Elig_Overlapping_Eligibility_Periods_Not_Allowed_MID"></a>Overlapping
            Eligibility Periods Not Allowed</h2>

        <p class="text">DIAMOND does not allow overlapping eligibility periods for
            a member. </p>

        <p class="text">Online, you cannot enter a member eligibility period with
            an Effective Date or Term Date that falls within an existing eligibility
            period for that member.</p>

        <p class="text">In Member Batch, if you submit a file that contains two overlapping
            eligibility records for the same member, DIAMOND processes them without
            creating overlapping periods. For processing details, see Member Batch,
            How DIAMOND Thinks&gt;Submitting Multiple Member Records in One Transaction
            user documentation.</p>
