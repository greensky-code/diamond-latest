        <h1 class="calibre1">Batch Claim Hold Release - How DIAMOND Thinks</h1>

        <p class="text">When you run a Batch Claim Hold Release (RHJOB) batch job
            in Run mode DIAMOND performs the following processing logic. Note that
            Run mode includes posting the results of the job to the claims tables.</p>

        <p class="text">The Batch Claim Hold Release process runs in the background
            and does not use Process EDI (PREDI) or Interface Job Setup (JOBLA) functionality.
            Also, since multiple sessions can be run, the Daemon will be invoked to
            launch the claims extract process.</p>

        <h3 class="calibre4">1. Selects Qualifying Claim Header Holds and Claim Detail Line Holds</h3>

        <p class="text">Claim header holds and claim detail line holds qualify if
            they satisfy all of the following requirements. If a claim header does
            not satisfy one of the conditions, neither the claim header holds nor
            the claim detail line holds qualify. However, an individual claim detail
            line failing to qualify does not affect whether the claim header holds
            or other claim detail line holds on the same claim qualify. </p>

        <ul class="calibre2">

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet"><p class="bullet">Claim type (Institutional
                or Professional) matches the Claim Type of the RHJOB Release Rule</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet"><p class="bullet">Claim Entered Date or Received
                Date (as selected on RHJOB) falls within the RHJOB Claim From Date to
                Claim Through Date range</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet"><p class="bullet">Claim header or detail line
                has an active Reason Code in the Hold Reasons table which matches one
                of the Reason Codes specified for the current RHJOB Release Rule (thus
                manual holds where a claim detail line Process Status was changed to Held
                but no Reason Code entered will not be selected)</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet"><p class="bullet">Claim header EOB Indicator
                = blank (If instead the EOB Indicator equals EOB or EOMB, that indicates
                that an EOB or EOMB (Explanation of Medicare Benefits) has been received
                for the claim from another commercial carrier or from Medicare, and that
                COB is pending)</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet"><p class="bullet">Claim header Audit Status
                does not equal C (If instead Audit Status = C, the claim has been processed
                through Auto Audit, Code Review, or Claim Check)</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet"><p class="bullet">Claim has not been whole
                claim priced (no informational lines) </p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet"><p class="bullet">Claim detail line Processing
                Status = H (Held)</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet"><p class="bullet">Claim detail line Adjudication
                Method = AA or A_ (Adjudication Method = AA means the line has been Automatically
                priced and Automatically adjudicated. Adjudication Method = A_ means the
                line has been Automatically priced only with no adjudication, which indicates
                that the claim was flagged as pre-price only in the corresponding GRUPD
                record. Qualifying Pre-price only detail lines will be processed during
                Batch Claim Hold Release but their reprocessing will include repricing
                only, not adjudication.)</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet"><p class="bullet">Claim header and detail satisfy
                the determinant values set up for the Release Rule in RHDET. </p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet"><p class="bullet">Claim detail line Other Carrier
                Amount = 0 and Other Carrier Allowed Amount =0 (means the line has not
                been processed through COB calculations)</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet"><p class="bullet">Claim detail line Process
                Status is not equal to F (Finalized), that is, the line has not been finalized.
                Non-finalized claim detail lines on the same claim as finalized detail
                lines may be processed by RHJOB if they meet all other requirements.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="calibre4">2. Checks RHRUL Apply to Header Only Checkbox</h3>

        <p class="text">If the RHRUL Apply to Header Only checkbox is selected for
            the current rule, no claim detail lines qualify for further processing.
            Skip to Step 4.</p>

        <p class="text">If the RHRUL Apply to Header Only checkbox is not selected
            for the current rule, proceed to Step 3.</p>

        <h3 class="calibre4">3. Marks Claim Detail Line Holds as Historical</h3>

        <p class="text">For each qualifying claim header and claim detail line, marks
            the matching hold reason record (i.e. the hold reason record which matches
            a Hold Reason for the current Release Rule) in the Hold Reason Table as
            Historical (selects the History checkbox). This means that these holds
            are no longer active. Also sets Update Process = BHREL (Batch Hold Release).</p>

        <h3 class="calibre4">4. Marks Header Holds as Historical</h3>

        <p class="text">For each qualifying claim, marks the matching hold reason
            record (i.e. the hold reason record which matches a Hold Reason for the
            current Release Rule) in the Hold Reason Table as Historical (selects
            the History checkbox). This means that these holds are no longer active.
            Also sets Update Process = BHREL (Batch Hold Release).</p>

        <h3 class="calibre4">5. Checks RHJOB Reapply Header Holds Checkbox</h3>

        <ul class="calibre2">

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet"><p class="bullet">If the Reapply Header Holds
                check box is selected, CLHLD header hold rules are reapplied in the next
                step below. (Note that only CLHLD user-defined header hold rules are reapplied.
                Other header hold rules such as DUPRL or ARULE are not reapplied.)</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet"><p class="bullet">If the Reapply Header Holds
                check box is NOT selected, CLHLD header hold rules are NOT reapplied in
                the next step below.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="calibre4">6. Re-Prices and Re-Adjudicates Qualifying Claim Headers and Detail
            Lines</h3>

        <p class="text">Reprocesses qualifying claim headers and detail lines as
            described below, with the following exceptions, and posts the results.</p>

        <ul class="calibre2">

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet"><p class="bullet">Exception: If a claim or
                claim detail line generates a critical error during the batch hold release
                job, the claim or detail line is not updated with the results of the job.
                It will be unchanged from prior to the job. However, the Batch Claim Hold
                Release process will complete and post other results as far as it is able.
                (One or more critical errors does not keep the job from posting results
                as is the case with Claims Batch.) This means, for example, if a claim
                has three qualifying claim detail lines and one generates a critical error
                but the others do not, then the two which did not will have the results
                posted while the one which did generate the critical error will be unchanged.
                The two claim lines which had results posted then appear on the Hold Release
                Detail Report. The claim line which generated the critical error appears
                on the Hold Release Critical Error Report.</p></li>

            <!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}--> When
            a qualifying claim detail line is reprocessed, a line previously denied
            may now not be denied if the circumstance that originally denied the line
            is no longer in effect. Conversely, a line previously not denied may be
            denied when the claim is reprocessed. Other logic that is redone as noted
            above may also have different results than previously, including pricing
            and adjudication.</p>
