<h4 class="calibre1">Administrative Fees, How DIAMOND Thinks</h4>

<p class="body-text">Health plans sometimes offer administrative fees to
 providers who submit complete and appropriate data on qualifying services
 they provide to their patients. </p>

<p class="text">Administrative fees are sometimes referred to as service
 administrative fees. They can be fees charged to a provider by a health
 plan for not completing some sort of task in the required manner. For
 example, if the provider does not provide sufficient information on a
 submitted claim. </p>

<p class="text">Administrative fees can also be fees paid to a provider by
 a health plan for completing a task in a desired manner. For example,
 a provider may receive a bonus from a health plan for sending claims electronically
 instead of on paper. </p>

<p class="body-text">You can add administrative fee rules using keyword ADRUL
 (Provider Administrative Fee Rule) to define the services that are considered
 when determining an administrative fee. You can include selection criteria,
 such as procedure code, primary diagnosis code, age of member, and whether
 the submitted claim is clean or unclean.</p>

<p class="body-text">For more information about adding administrative fee
 rules, see <a href="Setting_Up_Administrative_Fees.htm">Setting Up Administrative
 Fees</a>.</p>

<p class="body-text">When a service meets the rule determinants and other
 specified criteria, the administrative fee is charged. The transaction
 is then finalized, an accounts payable record is created, and the vendor
 is paid during the normal accounts payable process in a separate check.
 Claims are evaluated for administrative fees and transaction records are
 created in a batch process in keyword JOBAD (Administrative Fee Batch
 Job).</p>

<p class="body-text">If a claim is reversed or adjusted after calculating
 administrative fees, the administrative fees are not reversed automatically.
 You must manually reverse administrative fees. </p>

<p class="body-text">You can finalize only administrative fee transactions,
 or you can finalize administrative fee transactions along with other claims
 and advance pay transactions.</p>

<p class="body-text">You can use keyword CKPRT to generate just an administrative
 fee check or you can use CKPRT to print checks for administrative fees,
 advance payment, and claims. In any of these cases, a separate check is
 generated for administrative fees and advance payment.</p>
