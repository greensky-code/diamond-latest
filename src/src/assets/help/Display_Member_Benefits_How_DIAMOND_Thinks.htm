        <p class="doc-level"><a name="DispMemBene_HOT_MemBeneDispOvw_MID"></a>Using
            Keyword DSPBN - Overview</p>

        <p class="body-text">Use keyword DSPBN (Display Benefits Accumulators) to
            display a member’s benefit information and current benefit status as of
            a specific date, including the member’s benefit rule IDs, benefit rule
            limits, expended benefit amounts, and remaining benefit amounts. </p>

        <p class="body-text">You select a specific benefit rule ID to display all
            of the member’s claims that have been processed against the benefit rule.
            You can also drill down to display the fields associated with a claim
            detail line.</p>

        <p class="body-text">An accumulator file tracks a member’s deductibles, maximums,
            and limits. A member’s copayment and coinsurance amounts will be accumulated
            only if there are out-of-pocket maximums, deductibles, or limits associated
            with them. Denied and held claims are not accumulated. Accumulator file
            values are expressed in either dollars (for example, deductibles) or numeric
            value (for example, quantity). The accumulator file contains one record
            per claim detail line, per benefit rule applied to that detail line. For
            example, if a claim detail line has a deductible amount of $100 and an
            out-of-pocket expense total of $500, then two benefit accumulator records
            are added to the accumulator file: one for the deductible rule ($100),
            and one for the out-of-pocket expense rule ($500).</p>

        <p class="body-text">When a claim is adjudicated, DIAMOND "sums up"
            a member’s appropriate claim benefit accumulator records based on certain
            parameters in the corresponding benefit rule (BRULE); such as, time frame,
            carryover, all groups, and member/family.</p>

        <p class="body-text">A members benefit history varies depending on the benefit
            rule. For example:</p>

        <ul class="calibre15">

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">Lifetime
                Maximum Rule</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p class="body-text-block">All accumulated records for this rule are included
            in the benefit history calculation.</p>

        <ul class="calibre15">

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">Annual Family
                Deductible Rule</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p class="body-text-block">Accumulated records for all family members for
            the current<span class="calibre20"> year</span> are included
            in the benefit history calculation.</p>

        <ul class="calibre15">

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">Copayment
                Rule</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p class="body-text-block">Accumulated records based on specific BRULE attributes
            are included in the benefit history calculation; such as, Med Defs, Reason
            Code, Time Frame + No. Years/Days, Carryover + No. Years/Days, Member/Family,
            and Other Med Defs.</p>

            Although the As of Date search logic is the same as for non-renewable
