        <p class="body-text">When you save a claim detail line, <span class="calibre156">DIAMOND</span>
            compares the Adj Method field on the claim detail line to the member’s
            associated group price/adjudication requirement. If the member’s group
            pricing is set to adjudicate (in keyword GRUPD, the Group Req list is
            set to A – Adjud), then you must adjudicate the line before you save it.</p>

        <h2 class="calibre3"><a name="DNCLM_How_DIAMOND_Determines_Member_Eligibility_MID"></a>How
            DIAMOND Determines Member Eligibility</h2>

        <p class="body-text">DIAMOND uses the service date from the Dental Services
            Claims Header window to determine if the member is eligible. If a through
            date is entered, then DIAMOND verifies the member’s eligibility based
            on both dates. DIAMOND displays a warning if the member is ineligible
            or if the member’s eligibility expired before the through date.</p>

        <p class="body-text">If DIAMOND determines the claim is eligible, then it
            performs checks for coordination of benefits (COB), student dependent
            status, and pre-existing conditions. <span class="calibre156">DIAMOND</span>
            displays a warning message if it finds exceptions to eligibility. </p>

        <p class="body-text">During adjudication, DIAMOND validates that the date
            of service falls within the date range of one of the member’s eligibility
            periods. If it does not, then the line is denied. DIAMOND sets the claim
            status to Denied, sets the allowed amt and total not covered amounts to
            $0.00, and assigns the reason code associated with reason code type ME
            as the Not Cov Rsn code. Reason code type ME (only one is allowed) must
            exist in keyword REASN.</p>

        <p class="body-text">If the member is ineligible (the claim date of service
            is outside of the member’s eligibility period), then the claim is denied.
            If the eligibility status on the member record is invalid because it does
            not match the valid codes stored in the ELIGSTAT parameter, then the claim
            is held.</p>

        <p class="body-text">There are additional methods that can automatically
            hold a claim. For more information, see <a href="Claim_Holds_How_DIAMOND_Thinks_HDT.htm">Claim
                Holds, How DIAMOND Thinks</a>. </p>

        <p class="body-text">You can manually price, adjudicate, or expense a dental
            services claim when a member is outside an eligibility period. However,
            these claims cannot be finalized; because there is no group or plan information
            on the claim header, DIAMOND cannot validate the Group Req Indicator and,
            therefore, cannot set the appropriate flag on the Pre_Price_Only column.</p>

        <h3 class="calibre4">Member Eligibility Changes After a Claim Has Been Processed</h3>

        <p class="body-text"><span class="calibre156">DIAMOND</span>
            takes a "snapshot" of the member’s benefit package/plan/rule(s)
            to be used during the claim adjudication process as soon as the member
            identification is displayed. If the associated benefit package/plan/rules
            (BENEF, BRULE) are changed after the benefits snapshot, the benefit changes
            are not immediately updated on the still open claim header window and
            <span class="calibre156">DIAMOND</span> uses the benefit
            snapshot (old benefit data) if the claim is adjudicated during the claim
            entry session. However, the updated benefit data will display when you
            exit and then re-open the claim. If the claim was adjudicated using old
            benefits (snapshot) data, then on the Special menu, point to Pricing and
            Adjudication, and then click Adjudicate<span class="calibre5">
 </span>Claim to re-adjudicate the claim to include the updated (changed)
            benefit data.</p>

        <p class="body-text">Each time a claim is entered, <span class="calibre156">DIAMOND</span>
            automatically checks for duplicate claims based on the duplicate checking
            criteria set up for the line of business associated with the claim. See

        <h2 class="calibre3"><a name="DNCLM_Tooth_Rules_MID"></a>Tooth Rules</h2>

        <p class="body-text">You use tooth rules to restrict data entry for tooth
            fields; for example, you can create a tooth rule to restrict the member’s
            age for particular procedures or to specify that only certain surfaces
            are valid for a procedure performed on a certain tooth. Each tooth rule
            applies either to a specific tooth number, to a specific procedure code,
            or to a combination of tooth number and procedure code.</p>

        <p class="body-text">Tooth rules restrict data entry in the following keywords:</p>

        <ul class="calibre2">

        </ul>

        <p class="body-text">Each tooth rule includes an effective date and a termination
            date. You must supply an effective date. The effective date determines
            the date when this tooth rule becomes active. You do not need to supply
            a termination date; however, you can do so if you no longer want DIAMOND
            to evaluate this tooth rule. </p>

        <p class="body-text">Within each tooth rule, you can set criteria such as
            an acceptable age range or acceptable values for each of the tooth fields.
            A tooth rule will only be applied to a claim if the claim matches all
            of the criteria defined in the tooth rule.</p>

        <h3 class="calibre4">Rule Criteria</h3>

        <p class="body-text">For each rule, you can set the following criteria:</p>

        <ul class="calibre2">

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h1"><p class="bullet-list-h1">From Age</p></li>

        </ul>

        <p class="doc-level2">From Age and To Age</p>

        <p class="body-text">Use the From Age and To Age fields to set the acceptable
            age range for this tooth rule. If the member’s age does not fall within
            the acceptable range for the procedure code specified, DIAMOND will not
            allow the claim entry to continue. The claims entry operator must then
            supply an acceptable age for the member, or change the procedure code
            in order to complete claim entry. </p>

        <p class="doc-level2">Surfaces, Arch, Quadrant, and Oral Cavity</p>

        <p class="body-text">Each of these fields on TRULE displays information (All,
            Some, or None) from its associated command window located on the Special
            menu. In each of these command windows you can specify that you want a
            rule to match on all of the codes, or you can specify particular codes.

        <h2 class="calibre3"><a name="DNCLM_Tooth_History_MID"></a>Tooth History</h2>

        <p class="body-text">Use the THIST (Tooth History) window to store and maintain
            a history of all dental procedures performed on members.</p>

        <p class="body-text">Each time you enter a new dental services claim, whether
            you enter it online or through the DDS API, DIAMOND automatically adds
            a corresponding tooth history record. You can also manually enter tooth
            history records into THIST. The Source Type field on the THIST window
            indicates if a tooth history record was automatically created or if it
            was manually entered. You cannot edit or delete automatically created
            tooth history records; however, you can edit or delete manually entered
            tooth history records.</p>

        <p class="body-text">Whether or not the tooth fields on the THIST screen
            are required is determined by the procedure code entered for the claim
            line and how that procedure code is set up in PROCD. See <a
                    href="Dental_Services_Claims_Processing_How_DIAMOND_Thinks.htm#DNCLM_Making_Tooth_Fields_Required_MID">Making
                Tooth Fields Required</a>.</p>

        <p class="body-text">You can use information stored in tooth history to determine
            if a newly submitted claim is clinically appropriate. To do this, you
            set up claim evaluation rules in keyword CERUL. For more information,
            see <a href="Dental_Services_Claims_Processing_How_DIAMOND_Thinks.htm#DNCLM_Claim_Evaluation_Rules_MID">Claim
                Evaluation Rules</a>. </p>

        <p class="body-text"><a href="Dental_Services_Claims_Processing_How_DIAMOND_Thinks.htm">Top</a></p>

        <h2 class="calibre3"><a name="DNCLM_Claim_Evaluation_Rules_MID"></a>Claim Evaluation Rules</h2>

        <p class="body-text">Use CERUL (Claim Evaluation Rules) to build rules that
            test the clinical appropriateness of claim detail lines. In the case of
            dental claims, you can build rules that will check against tooth history;
            for example, if a claim is submitted for a sealant procedure, DIAMOND
            can check in THIST (Tooth History) to ensure that the tooth has not been
            extracted in a previous claim. If DIAMOND determines, based on a claim
            evaluation rule, that the claim line is clinically inappropriate, it can
            provide a warning or it can apply a hold or deny status to the line depending
            on the action defined in the evaluation rule. If a hold or deny status
            is applied to the claim, the associated reason code (if one is specified
            in CERUL) is also applied to the claim. </p>

        <p class="body-text">The Message to Operator field on CERUL allows you to
            define a message of up to 60 alphanumeric characters that will be displayed
            to the claim entry operator if that rule is selected as a match for the
            claim.</p>

        <p class="body-text">For each claim evaluation rule, you define determinants
            that are used when DIAMOND is evaluating the rules against new claims,
            you can also define history matching criteria. History matching criteria
            determines whether or not DIAMOND searches through tooth history and if
            so, the timeframe within which it will search. </p>

        <p class="body-text">You can make a claim evaluation rule inactive by clearing
            the Active checkbox on CERUL.</p>

        <h3 class="calibre4">Rule Order ID</h3>

        <p class="body-text">Rule Order ID is how DIAMOND determines the order in
            which it evaluates the rules. Claim evaluation rules are evaluated in
            order from lowest number to highest number. DIAMOND stops searching as
            soon as it finds a rule that matches the information on the claim line;
            therefore, the more specific rules should have lower rule order numbers,
            while the more general rules should have higher rule order numbers. </p>

        <h3 class="calibre4">Search Sequences</h3>

        <p class="body-text">Each rule must have at least one search sequence and
            each search sequence must have a determinant table and a column selected.
            Search sequences may have multiple determinants defined. Search sequences
            are evaluated in numeric order, from the lowest number to the highest.
        </p>

        <p class="body-text">If you define multiple search sequences for a claim
            evaluation rule, only claims that meet the criteria of all search sequences
            will match the rule.</p>

        <h3 class="calibre4">History Matching Criteria</h3>

        <p class="body-text">You can specify primary, secondary, and additional filters
            to use as matching criteria. DIAMOND compares the matching criteria you
            specify against any records it finds in tooth history to see if it can
            find a match.</p>

        <p class="body-text">Primary matching criteria:</p>

        <ul class="calibre2">

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h1"><p class="bullet-list-h1">Tooth Number</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h1"><p class="bullet-list-h1">Quadrant,
                regardless of tooth</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h1"><p class="bullet-list-h1">Arch, regardless
                of tooth</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h1"><p class="bullet-list-h1">Blank, no
                primary match selection applies</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p class="body-text">Secondary matching criteria:</p>

        <ul class="calibre2">

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h1"><p class="bullet-list-h1">Provider
                (rendering provider on the claim header)</p></li>

        </ul>

        <p class="body-text">Additional matching criteria:</p>

        <ul class="calibre2">

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h1"><p class="bullet-list-h1">Medical Definitions</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p class="doc-level2">Secondary Matching Criteria</p>

        <p class="body-text">If you want the secondary matching criteria to be an
            exact match, then place a check in the appropriate secondary match box
            on CERUL. If you want to specify that all values are acceptable or if
            you want to define individual and or ranges of values for any of the secondary
            matching criteria, you must use the appropriate command window available
            from the Special menu on CERUL. Each of these command windows allows you
            to select a check box that indicates that all values are acceptable. They
            each also include options for you to include or exclude single values
            or ranges of values.</p>

        <h3 class="calibre4">History Search Timeframe</h3>

        <p class="body-text">You can specify any one of the following choices as
            a timeframe:</p>

        <ul class="calibre2">

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h1"><p class="bullet-list-h1">Calendar
                year</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h1"><p class="bullet-list-h1">Lifetime</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p class="body-text">No matter which timeframe option you select, DIAMOND
            uses the claim detail line’s From Date Of Service as the start date and
            searches backward through the history records. </p>

        <p class="body-text">A covering provider is, usually, a physician who provides
            services in the absence of a PCP to that PCP’s assigned members. When
            a covering provider renders services in this role, he or she may be paid
            according to the PCP’s contract rather than his or her own, or may not,
            depending on the rules of the health plan, the nature of the contracts,
            and health plan practices.</p>

        <p class="body-text">DIAMOND provides a mechanism for recognizing potential
            covering provider situations and allowing the covering provider to be
            paid according to a PCP’s provider contract PROVC record. You can set
            up covering providers with a default action, use the PCP’s contract or
            use their own contract, and this default action can also be overridden
            manually during claims processing.</p>

        <p class="body-text">Adjudication is the process in which benefit rules,
            determined by a member’s benefit package, are applied to the claim detail
            line. This results in the calculation of deductibles, not-covered amounts,
            co-payments, coinsurance, and exclusions that may reduce the amount paid
            to the provider. When a claim is adjudicated, each claim detail line is
            both priced (an allowed amount is calculated) and adjudicated (benefit
            rules are applied). For additional information, see <a href="Benefits.chm::/About_BENEF.htm">BENEF

        <p class="body-text">As part of the adjudication process, DIAMOND includes
            Coordination of Benefits (COB) processing when applicable. For more information

        <h3 class="calibre4">Calculating the Net Amount</h3>

        <p class="body-text">DIAMOND calculates the claim detail line Net Amount
            differently depending on whether the line is automatically or manually
            adjudicated, and whether a COB calculation method applies.</p>

        <p class="numbered-list">1. When DIAMOND automatically adjudicates a
            claim line and no COB<span class="calibre5"> </span>applies:</p>

        <p class="formula">Net Amount = Allowed Amt - Total Not Cov - Total Copay
            - Total Co-ins - Total Deduct - Pt Liability amounts for Benefit Rule
            type 99 (Other) - Withhold Amt</p>

        <p class="body-text-block">In some cases, the sum total of the Withhold Amt
            and the patient liabilities (including not covered amounts) may be greater
            than the Allowed Amt. In these situations, rather than placing a negative
            dollar amount in the Net Amount field, DIAMOND sets the Net Amount field
            to 0 and stores the overage figure in the Withhold Surplus field.</p>

        <p class="body-text-block">The Total Co-ins amount is the sum of all calculated
            coinsurance amounts. DIAMOND calculates each coinsurance amount as the
            benefit rule coinsurance percentage (BRULE Coinsure %) times the claim
            detail line allowed amount <span class="calibre5">net of any
 other benefit rules applied before the current coinsurance rule</span>.
            (You set the processing order for benefit rules in each benefit package.)
            That is, DIAMOND calculates coinsurance on a decreasing total based on
            the application of any prior ordered benefit rules.</p>

        <p class="body-text-block">Example:</p>

        <p class="body-text-block2">Allowed Amount = 200.00</p>

        <p class="body-text-block2">Benefit Rules in processing order: </p>

        <p class="body-text-block2">1. Copay = 10.00</p>

        <p class="body-text-block2">2. Deductible = 50.00</p>

        <p class="body-text-block2">3. Coinsurance1 = 20%</p>

        <p class="body-text-block2">4. Coinsurance2 = 10%</p>

        <p class="body-text-block2">Coinsurance1 and Coinsurance2 amounts
            are calculated as follows:</p>

        <p class="body-text-block2">200.00 (Allowed Amount) - 10.00 (Copay)
            = 190.00</p>

        <p class="body-text-block2">190.00 - 50.00 (Deductible) = 140.00</p>

        <p class="body-text-block2">140.00 x 20% (Coinsurance1) = 28.00</p>

        <p class="body-text-block2">140.00 - 28.00 = 112.00</p>

        <p class="body-text-block2">112.00 x 10% (Coinsurance2) = 11.20</p>

        <p class="body-text-block2">112.00 - 11.20 = 100.80</p>

        <p class="numbered-list">2. When DIAMOND automatically adjudicates a

            methods.</p>

        <p class="numbered-list-indent">Note: </p>

        <p class="body-text-block">For a COB claim that is automatically adjudicated,
            if the provider on the claim has a contract that includes a provider withhold

            If you use a non-specific provider, you must specify a vendor during claims
            processing. Use of the non-specific provider and default provider features
            to handle out of plan or one-time providers requires careful setup. For
