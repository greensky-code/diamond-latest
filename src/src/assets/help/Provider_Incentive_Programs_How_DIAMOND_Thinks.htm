        <h1 class="calibre1">Provider Incentive Programs, How DIAMOND Thinks</h1>

        <p class="text">A provider incentive program is an effort by an HMO to reward
            providers for enacting quality programs or to create a financial incentive
            to enact additional quality programs. For example, providers sometimes
            enact quality programs, such as extended hours, to increase customer satisfaction.</p>

        <p class="text">Payments are also offered to capitated providers who meet
            the user’s configurable definition of an open panel, defined as Access
            Program. The provider’s eligibility for the various quality programs is
            recorded on the provider contract record and is maintained by the user.
            Documentation in support of this eligibility is maintained by the user
            outside of the DIAMOND program. The eligibility for an Access Program
            payment is determined by evaluating several existing check boxes and values
            relating to provider enrollment. The user may also designate the provider’s
            eligibility for Access Program as an override of the system evaluation.
            A new keyword holds information on which Quality Programs and Access Program
            are in effect, provider selection criteria, and the amount per enrolled
            member or percent of capitation to be applied. The amount is multiplied
            by the provider’s enrolled members during calculation of capitation, and
            the result is included in the capitation check. The user can also specify
            the amount of the payment as a percentage of the capitation payment.</p>

        <h2 class="calibre22">Calculating capitation payments</h2>

        <p class="text">When calculating the Incentive Program payment, capitation
            calculation will look at the rules in keyword INRUL (Incentive Rules)
            to determine which programs are in effect for a provider. The system will
            then look at the provider’s contract record in keyword PROVC (Provider
            Contract) and the provider enrollment record in keyword PROVE (Provider
            Enrollment) to determine if the provider is eligible for the particular
            program. If so, the dollar amount on INRUL and the provider’s enrolled
            members are used to determine the total payment, which is added to the
            capitation payment. If the provider is eligible for more than one payment,
            the amounts are additive. </p>
