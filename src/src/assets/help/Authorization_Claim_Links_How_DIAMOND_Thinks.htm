        <p class="text">A match between a claim being processed and a previously
            entered authorization can be determined manually or automatically. The
            LINBS record determines whether DIAMOND will attempt to automatically
            match authorizations to claims (during the initial save of the claim header
            only) by enabling this feature when the <span class="calibre5">Auth/Claim
 Match</span> check box is selected.</p>

        <p class="text">Regardless of whether the match is automatic or manual (see
            "Mechanics of manually matching an authorization to a claim"
            and "Mechanics of automatic authorization/claim matching" sections
            below), DIAMOND enforces matching on certain fields and conditions according
            to the rules you enter in keyword MCHRL. MCHRL is used to identify unique
            or multiple potential matching authorizations during claims processing
            automatically (according to the LINBS entry) and also to make sure that
            an authorization number manually entered on a claim is a matching authorization.
            This prevents a claims processing user from linking an unrelated authorization
            to a claim.</p>

        <p class="bulletlvl2cont">For example, a heart transplant requires authorization
            like any other major surgical procedure. In addition, though, the heart

            The hold code and hold reason are included in the MCHRL rule defining
            a heart transplant. When a heart transplant claim is entered and matched
            to the heart transplant authorization, the hold code and hold reason from
            the MCHRL are automatically entered on the claim.</p>

                These criteria include whether or not the authorization has expired prior
                to the dates of service on the claim, whether the authorization has already
                been closed or ‘used up’ by being linked to previous claims, whether the
                dates of service are outside the authorized range of dates, and the like.
                DIAMOND will take automatic action on the claim, as defined in ARULE,

        <h2 class="calibre3"><a name="Authorization_Claim_Links_Using_the_date_range_match_criteria_MID"></a>Using
            the ‘date range’ match criteria</h2>

        <h3 class="calibre4">MCHRL vs. ARULE and defining the date range</h3>

        <p class="text">While there are differences in attributes and functions between
            MCHRL and ARULE, both MCHRL and ARULE can be used to define date ranges
            on the authorization within which the claim dates of service must fall.
            Technically either or both can be used for this purpose. However, in order
            to minimize claims processing and customer and provider service issues,
            Perot Systems recommends that one or the other be selected during implementation
            and that administrative procedures be defined to enforce this use.</p>

        <h3 class="calibre4">Date ranges for covering providers</h3>

        <p class="text">MCHRL does not apply to situations where a covering provider
            is rendering the service. In that case, instead of MCHRL, DIAMOND uses
            hard-coded match logic, see "How DIAMOND decides if an authorization
            matches a claim, PSCLM/DNCLM covering providers". When a covering
            provider renders the service, the only place you can define date range
            match criteria is in ARULE. </p>

        <h3 class="calibre4">Which dates are used to calculate the date range?</h3>

        <p class="text">For all claim types, the Days After and Days Before entries
            in LINBS are added to and subtracted from the primary date of service
            on the claim header (PSCLM Svc Date; INCLM Admit Date; DNCLM Svc Date).
            If the request date on the authorization is within the calculated range,
            it is a potentially valid authorization for the subject claim and is eligible
            for matching.</p>

        <h2 class="calibre3"><a name="Determining_whether_to_look_for_a_match"></a>Determining whether
            to look for a match</h2>

        <p class="text">There is a single trigger in DIAMOND that launches the process
            (or processes) to attempt to find an authorization record which matches
            the claim being processed. That single trigger is the record in LINBS
            associated with the member’s eligibility. If the Auth/Claim Match check
            box is selected, DIAMOND will attempt to find a matching authorization.
            If it is not selected, no such attempt will be made, although a match
            can be made manually by the claims processor.</p>

        <p class="text">This automatic trigger is invoked regardless of whether any
            actions would result if the claim were or were not authorized. </p>

        <p class="text">DIAMOND automatically executes table-driven authorization/claim
            matching only during the initial save of the claim header. After that,
            if a change is made to the claim header, you must use the Special menu
            command Authorization Match/Waive, options Reapply Match or Reapply Match_Waive
            to again execute table-driven authorization/claim matching logic using
            the revised data.</p>

        <h2 class="calibre3"><a name="Matching_authorizations_to_claims"></a>Matching authorizations
            to claims</h2>

        <p class="text">There are two functions in DIAMOND that contain the rules
            used to determine if any authorizations are matched, or potentially matched,
            to a claim being processed. In both cases, the LINBS record ‘turns on’
            the automatic matching function. </p>

        <h3 class="calibre4">PSCLM/DNCLM covering providers</h3>

        <p class="text">For PSCLM and DNCLM claims submitted by providers who are
            covering for the originally authorized provider, DIAMOND has a set of
            hard-coded rules that are used to evaluate for a match. This set of rules
            is invoked so long as LINBS has checks in both Auth/Claim Match and Covering
            Prov. These hard-coded rules replace the rules set up in MCHRL for other
            claim situations.</p>

        <h2 class="calibre3"><a name="Authorization_Claim_Links_Waiving_the_requirement_for_authorization_MID"></a>Waiving
            authorization requirements</h2>

        <p class="text">Keyword AWAVE (Auth Waive Rules) allows you to automatically
            waive the need for claim authorizations under particular circumstances.
            For example, a health care plan may waive the need for an authorization
            for outpatient procedures so long as they are performed at a participating
            hospital by a participating attending physician. When the claim is saved
            DIAMOND applies authorization waiver rules to claims for members whose
            line of business so requires according to the LINBS record <span class="calibre5">Perform
 Auth Waive</span> check box.</p>

        <p class="text">You can define AWAVE rules using as many criteria on the
            claim header as you need, with effective dates for each rule and an order
            in which the rules are applied. DIAMOND uses fall through logic, similar
            to its use in MEDEF.</p>

        <p class="text">When the claim header data satisfies all of the determinant
            values on an AWAVE rule, the need for an authorization is waived and the
            Method on the claim is set to A.</p>

        <p class="text">When the claim header does not satisfy all of the determinant
            values on an AWAVE rule, any logic based on the existence of an authorization
            is applied depending on whether or not an authorization number is attached
            to the claim, and the Method remains unchanged, either M or blank.</p>

        <p class="text">AWAVE is integrated with Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).</p>

        <p class="text">DIAMOND allows you to maintain an audit trail of authorization
            waive rule adds, updates and deletes. You may view this audit trail information
            using the AWAVE Window menu command Audit Display. For more information,
            see the process overview Managing the Authorizations Audit Trail.</p>

        <h3 class="calibre4">Effect of waiving authorization requirements</h3>

        <p class="text">Certain benefits vary depending on whether a claim is authorized.
            In the absence of authorization, a lesser amount may be reimbursed or
            the service not covered at all. However, when an AWAVE rule is applied
            to that claim, the benefit reduction is not calculated and the claim is
            reimbursed as if it were authorized.</p>

        <h3 class="calibre4">Effective dates of rules and retroactive application</h3>

        <p class="text">Keyword AWAVE allows you to enter new waiver conditions and
            rules with retroactive effective dates. Theoretically, such rules should
            apply to claims that have already been processed. However, DIAMOND does
            not automatically retroactively apply AWAVE rules. In order to apply such
            newly-entered rules to older claims, retrieve each claim online and apply
            the Special menu command Authorization Match/Waive &gt; options Reapply
            Waive or Reapply Match_Waive.</p>

        <h3 class="calibre4">Using the Authorization Class to Waive Authorizations</h3>

        <p class="text">In some cases, the requirement that a claim be authorized
            may be waived when the attending or referring provider is participating.
            (This is in contrast to other authorization waivers that depend on the
            provider of service<span class="calibre157">.</span>) Because
            claims logic does not look at the contract information for the attending
            or referring provider, authorization waivers cannot use participation
            status or other contractual indicators. Therefore, in order to be able
            to waive the authorization requirement for attending or referring providers,
            you must mark a provider as "participating" in another way.
            You do this by first entering a valid value in the Auth Class field on
            the corresponding Provider Master record. Then, in AWAVE, you enter a
            rule using Auth Class as a determinant, with that same valid value as
            the determinant value.</p>

        <h3 class="calibre4">Determining the order in which rules are evaluated</h3>

        <p class="text">By default, claim processing first evaluates the auth/claim
            match rules in keyword MCHRL. Then, claim processing evaluates the auth
            waive rules in keyword AWAVE. However, you can reverse the order in which
            claim processing evaluates the rules by setting the Waive Match Order
            field in keyword LINBS.</p>

        <h2 class="calibre3"><a name="Authorization_Claim_Links_Provider_Data_Carryover_MID"></a>Provider
            Data Carryover</h2>

        <p class="text">As each provider is entered on an AUTHS record, he or she
            is associated with a code that indicates the role the provider is authorized
            for, such as admitting physician, referring provider, institution, and
            the like. When the authorization is linked to a claim, this code tells
            DIAMOND which provider ID to put in each provider field on that claim.
            Admitting, attending, and institutional providers are linked to the same
            fields on an Institutional claim (INCLM). Referring and facility providers
            are linked to the same fields on the professional services (PSCLM) or
            dental (DNCLM) claim; Referral provider on the AUTHS record is linked
            to provider on the claim.</p>
