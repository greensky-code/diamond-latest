        <h4 class="calibre1">Dual Coverage - Overview</h4>

        <p class="doc-level">Background</p>

        <p class="body-text">Occasionally an individual has membership in more than
            one health plan. This can occur when:</p>

        <ul class="calibre15">

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">One spouse
                is a subscriber through his or her employer group and at the same time
                is enrolled as a dependent on his or her spouse’s account with another
                employer group</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">A member
                is working two jobs and he or she is the subscriber in both instances</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p class="body-text">The use of DIAMOND IDs allows dual coverage to be tracked
            in DIAMOND. A person may have more than one Member Master record in keyword
            MEMBR (Member Master) but has only one DIAMOND ID. </p>

        <p class="body-text">An example is a woman who has coverage through her place
            of employment where she is the subscriber in the Member Master record
            (DIAMOND Subscriber Number XXXX, Person Number 01). She is also insured
            through her husband’s employer where she is the spouse in the Member Master
            record (DIAMOND Subscriber Number XXXX, Person Number 02). Both groups
            are in DIAMOND. The woman has one DIAMOND ID but there are two Member
            Master records for her in DIAMOND. The Dual Coverage Indicator on the
            MEMBR window shows that this situation exists.</p>

        <p class="body-text">In DIAMOND, each instance of an individual with health
            plan coverage equals one Member Master record. This means that one individual
            could have more than one Member Master record in DIAMOND.</p>

        <p class="body-text">A DIAMOND ID is a unique alphanumeric identifier for
            each person in DIAMOND. A person who has membership in more than one health
            plan or group will have one DIAMOND ID but multiple Member Master records.</p>

        <p class="body-text">DIAMOND IDs are assigned via the MEMBR window (see MEMBR
            reference documentation for more information). Once they are assigned
            to each member in the system:</p>

        <ul class="calibre15">

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">New subscribers
                can be added either by DIAMOND ID or Subscriber ID </p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">A new subscriber
                can be added to an existing DIAMOND ID by selecting Special &gt; Add New
                Subscriber to DID in the MEMBR window</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">A dependent
                can be added by selecting Special &gt; Add Dependent in the MEMBR window</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">IDs can be
                changed by selecting Special &gt; Modify DID in the MEMBR window. </p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">Members with
                the same DIAMOND ID can be viewed by selecting Special &gt; View DID Members
                in the MEMBR window</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">ID Cards
                can be printed by setting Parameter 2 of IDCARDORDER to ‘D’. See PARAM
                reference documentation for more information</p></li>
        </ul>

            logic behind DIAMOND IDs.</p>
