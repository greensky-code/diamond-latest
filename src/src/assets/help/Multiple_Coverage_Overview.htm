        <h4 class="calibre1">Multiple Coverage Overview</h4>

        <p class="doc-level">Multiple Coverage functionality in DIAMOND</p>

        <p class="body-text">Multiple Coverage means that an individual has health
            insurance benefits from more than one carrier. Multiple Coverage functionality
            in DIAMOND consists of two components:</p>

        <p class="numbered-list">1. Dual Coverage</p>

        <p class="body-text">Occasionally an individual has membership in more than
            one Health Plan. This occurs when:</p>

        <ul class="calibre15">

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">One spouse
                is a subscriber through his or her employer group and at the same time
                is enrolled as a dependent on his or her spouse’s account with another
                employer group</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">A member
                is working two jobs and he or she is the subscriber in both instances</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p class="body-text">In DIAMOND, each instance of an individual with Health
            Plan coverage equals one Member Master record. Since one individual can
            have more than one Health Plan coverage, one individual can have more
            than one Member Master record in DIAMOND.</p>

        <p class="body-text">A DIAMOND ID is a unique alphanumeric identifier for
            each person in DIAMOND. A person who has membership in more than one Health
            Plan can have one DIAMOND ID and multiple Member Master records. A person
            who has membership in one Health Plan and a single Member Master Record
            can also have a DIAMOND ID. </p>

        <p class="body-text">You enable DIAMOND ID in the parameter DIDSEARCH. DIAMOND
            ID is an optional field.</p>

        <p class="body-text">DIAMOND IDs are assigned via the MEMBR window (see MEMBR
            reference documentation for more information). Once they are assigned
            to each member in the system:</p>

        <ul class="calibre15">

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">New subscribers
                can be added either by DIAMOND ID or Subscriber ID </p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">A new subscriber
                can be added to an existing DIAMOND ID by selecting Special &gt; Add New
                Subscriber to DID in the MEMBR window</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">A dependent
                can be added by selecting Special &gt; Add Dependent in the MEMBR window</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">IDs can be
                changed by selecting Special &gt; Modify DID in the MEMBR window. </p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">Members with
                the same DIAMOND ID can be viewed by selecting Special &gt; View DID Members
                in the MEMBR window</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">ID Cards
                can be printed by setting Parameter 2 of IDCARDORDER to ‘D’. See PARAM
                reference documentation for more information</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p class="body-text">See Dual Coverage, How DIAMOND Thinks for information
            about the processing logic behind DIAMOND IDs.</p>

        <p class="body-text">See Setting up DIAMOND IDs for implementation information.</p>

        <p class="body-text-block1"> </p>

        <p class="numbered-list">2. Coordination of Benefits (COB)</p>

        <p class="body-text">Coordination of Benefits (COB) is the process by which
            medical insurance benefits of multiple coverages are coordinated for a
            single claim. DIAMOND COB functionality allows you to coordinate additional
            coverage with the coverage on the DIAMOND claim to adjust the net amount
            paid by DIAMOND on a particular claim. The additional coverage could be
            another DIAMOND coverage or it could be from a carrier external to DIAMOND.
        </p>

        <p class="body-text">Several different COB calculation methods are available
            for commercial carriers and Medicare. You can also hold or deny claims
            based on COB criteria and track COB history. In addition, you can define
            rules to determine the COB application of benefits order (Primary, Secondary,
            Tertiary or Other) for each individual COB History record.</p>

        <p class="body-text">See Coordination of Benefits Overview for more information.</p>
