        <p class="body-text">Occasionally an individual has membership in more than
            one Health Plan. Typically, this occurs when:</p>

        <ul class="calibre15">

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">One spouse
                is a subscriber through his or her employer group and at the same time
                is enrolled as a dependent on his or her spouse’s account with another
                employer group</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">A member
                is working two jobs and is the subscriber in both instances</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p class="body-text">In DIAMOND, each instance of an individual with health
            plan coverage equals one Member Master record. This means that one individual
            could have more than one Member Master record in DIAMOND. A person with
            two or more Member Master records under one DIAMOND ID (DID) is considered
            to have dual coverage within DIAMOND.</p>

        <p class="body-text">A DIAMOND ID is a unique alphanumeric identifier common
            to all instances of a person in DIAMOND. A person who has membership in
            more than one health plan or group will have one DIAMOND ID but multiple
            Member Master records. </p>

        <p class="doc-level"><a name="DIAMID_CreatDID_MID"></a>Creating DIAMOND IDs</p>

        <p class="body-text">In order to implement DIAMOND ID functionality, a unique
            DIAMOND ID must be assigned to each current person in DIAMOND. These ID
            numbers can be assigned either by manual entry on the Member Master (MEMBR)
            window using the Special menu &gt; Add DIAMOND ID or by a custom program
            that is not written by Health Systems Design.</p>

        <p class="body-text">After all existing members have been assigned an ID,
            the parameter DIDSEARCH must then be set to ‘Y’.</p>

        <p class="body-text">After the parameter is set, all new members are required
            to have a DIAMOND ID.</p>

        <ul class="calibre15">

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">‘Y’ enables
                DIAMOND IDs</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">‘N’ is the
                default parameter. If ‘N’ is set, DIAMOND ID functionality is turned off
                and nulls are allowed.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p class="body-text">Once the parameter is turned on, a DIAMOND ID must be
            entered in the MEMBR window whenever a new instance of an individual is
            entered in DIAMOND.</p>

        <p class="body-text">DIAMOND ID functionality does not affect Alternate Member
            ID functionality.</p>

        <p class="doc-level"><a name="DIAMID_HDT_andMembrMstr_MID"></a>DIAMOND IDs,
            Member Master Records, and MEMBR</p>

        <p class="body-text">Members must have as many Member Master records as there
            are instances of coverage to be tracked and can be added as many times
            as required under dual coverage.</p>

        <p class="body-text">DIAMOND IDs are stored in the Member Master table only
            and have their own index. This record is not stored in any other table.
        </p>

        <p class="body-text">When a subscriber is added using DIAMOND IDs for the
            first time in the member master table, the DIAMOND ID value populates
            the Subscriber ID field on MEMBR. All family members have that Subscriber
            ID but have their own DIAMOND ID.</p>

        <p class="doc-level"><a name="DIAMID_HDT_AboutDualCovIndicator_MID"></a>About
            DIAMOND IDs and the Dual Coverage Indicator</p>

        <p class="body-text">The dual coverage indicator in keyword MEMBR identifies
            when more than one member master record shares a DIAMOND ID. If members
            are added to an existing DIAMOND ID, the Dual Coverage Indicator is set
            to ‘Y’ for all instances of a member where the DIAMOND ID is the same.</p>

        <p class="body-text">The dual coverage indicator (DUAL_COVERAGE_IND) is updated
            (added to or removed from) the member’s record if the DIAMOND ID is changed.
            For example, if a person exists twice in the database, both Member Master
            records have the Dual coverage Indicator set to ‘Y’. If the DIAMOND ID
            is changed on one of those two records, both Indicators are set to ‘N’.</p>

        <p class="body-text">If the parameter is not turned on, a DIAMOND ID can
            still be entered in keyword MEMBR on the Special menu &gt; Add DIAMOND
            ID field. If there is more then one member record with the same DIAMOND
            ID, the DUAL_COVERAGE_IND is set on both records.</p>

        <p class="doc-level"><a name="DIAMIDS_HDT_AboutParams_MID"></a>About the DIAMOND
            ID Parameter</p>

        <p class="body-text">Dual coverage is controlled by the parameter DIDSEARCH.</p>

        <p class="body-text">‘Y’ enables DIAMOND ID functionality.</p>

        <p class="body-text">‘N’ is the default parameter. If ‘N’ is set DIAMOND
            ID functionality is turned off.</p>

        <p class="body-text">If the parameter is turned off, the DIAMOND ID field
            is grayed out. The DID field in the Special menu &gt; Add DIAMOND ID in
            the MEMBR window is not grayed out, however.</p>

        <p class="body-text">If the parameter is turned off after it is set, new
            members can be associated with an existing DIAMOND ID by using the Special
            menu &gt; Add DIAMOND ID on the MEMBR window.</p>

        <p class="body-text">If the parameter is turned off, the DID field is grayed;
            and MEMBR Special commands Modify DID, Add New Subscriber to DID, and
            View DID Members are disabled. Then, a DIAMOND ID cannot be changed (using
            the Special &gt; Modify DID in the MEMBR window).</p>

        <p class="doc-level"><a name="DIAMIDS_HDT_AboutIDs_and_ClmsAuths_MID"></a>About
            DIAMOND IDs and Claims/Auths</p>

        <p class="body-text">The DIAMOND ID field is not required on Claims and Auths
            windows (keywords PSCLM, INCLM, DNCLM, DSPBN, CLDSP, AUTHS, and AUDSP).
        </p>

        <p class="body-text">When the DIAMOND ID functionality is enabled, if there
            is more than one member with this ID, a popup displays the other records
            so that the correct member can be selected. The popup displays the Sub
            ID, Person Number, Last Name, First Name and DIAMOND ID (If there is only
            one member with the DIAMOND ID entered, the popup doesn’t display.)</p>
