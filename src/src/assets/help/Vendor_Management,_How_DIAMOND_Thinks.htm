<h1 class="calibre3"><a name="Overview"></a>Overview </h1>

<p class="body-text">The DIAMOND system’s vendor management functionality 
 enables you to create advance payment accounts and make advance payments 
 to vendors thereby creating a credit balance, determine which claims payments 
 to offset against a vendor’s advance payment account, and to track the 
 current dollar value of a vendor’s advance payment account. </p>

<p class="body-text">Use the vendor management functionality to perform the 
 following tasks: </p>

<ul class="calibre6">
	
	<li class="kadov-p-cbullet1"><p class="bullet1">Make advance payments 
 to providers, and then offset (deduct) future claims payments from the 
 advance amount.</p></li>
	
	<li class="kadov-p-cbullet1"><p class="bullet1">Apply to accounts 
 payable non-DIAMOND checks you receive from vendors. </p></li>
	
	<li class="kadov-p-cbullet1"><p class="bullet1">Manually write-off 
 credit balances for advance payments or credit balances that are not created 
 by the advance payment process.</p></li>
	
	<li class="kadov-p-cbullet1"><p class="bullet1">Apply vendor advance 
 payments, claims offsets, balance transfers, and checks from the vendor 
 to the general ledger interface.</p></li>
	
	<li class="kadov-p-cbullet1"><p class="bullet1">View vendors advance 
 payment accounts showing credit balances and the respective claims that 
 have been paid against each advance payment account. </p></li>

<h2 class="calibre10">VADPR (Vendor Advance Payment Rules)</h2>

<p class="body-text">Use VADPR to define the rules that are in effect for 
 the advance Payment account types that you created in CODES. You can also 
 associate the rules you define in VADPR with Advance Payment Accounts 
 by referencing them in VADPY. You can define rules for the following:</p>

<ul class="calibre6">
	
	<li class="kadov-p-cbullet1"><p class="bullet1">Define whether 
 or not the advance payment account is one-time-only, or if it can be replenished 
 when it reaches a zero balance.</p></li>
	
	<li class="kadov-p-cbullet1"><p class="bullet1">Define which transactions, 
 those for matching vendors, members, or providers, will be used to offset 
 the advance payment account.</p></li>

 and to enter payment information for advance payment accounts. You can 
 enter information for payments that were made either through DIAMOND processing 
 or received from an outside source. Also use this keyword to set up rules 
 that define how the DIAMOND system will manage advance payments and offsets 
 for advance payment accounts. </p>

<h2 class="calibre10">View Vendor Credit Balance Special Function</h2>

<p class="body-text">This is a special function that is available from VENDR, 
 VENDA, VADPP, VADPY, and VENCR. Use this special function to view transaction 
 information and the current credit balance for a vendor’s advance payment 
 account. </p>

<h2 class="calibre10">VPDSP (Advance Payment History Display)</h2>

 this functionality directly related to advance payment accounts or was 
 this added as a separate feature – not sure if this should be included 
 in this list)</p>

<h2 class="calibre10">Vendor Credit Status Special Function</h2>

<p class="body-text">This is a special function that is available from VENCR. 
 Use this special function to view the Advance Payment Status window that 
 shows the current status of an advance payment.</p>

<h1 class="calibre3"><a name="APUPD_Accounts_Payable_Processing_Logic"></a>APUPD Accounts 
 Payable Processing Logic</h1>

<h2 class="calibre161">Accounts Payable Records </h2>

<p class="body-text">APUPD reads advance payment records and creates an accounts 
 payable record for every advance payment transaction that is in an active 
 status. The information you provide in the APUPD filter screen determines 
 which advance payment accounts are updated.</p>

<p class="body-text">APUPD creates two types of account payable records for 
 advance payment accounts: one for payments that represents a positive 
 amount and one for credit balances that represents a negative amount. 
 </p>

<p class="body-text">When you manually enter the check date and check number 
 for an advance payment, the DIAMOND system assumes that a check will not 
 be created and creates an accounts payable record as if it had already 
 been run through the check write and check post processes.</p>

<h2 class="calibre10">General Ledger Reference Accounts</h2>

<p class="body-text">APUPD creates entries into the general ledger file interface. 
 The DIAMOND system determines which GL Reference account codes to use 
 based on the Company Code and GL Reference codes you entered for the advance 
 payment account. </p>

<p class="body-text">You define which debit and credit accounts are used 
 for advance payments and for offsets in VADPY (Vendor Advance Payment 
 Account). If you use the advance payment debit and credit field on GLREF, 
 the values will be updated into accounts payable. If you don’t use the 
 advance payment debit and credit fields on GLREF, the primary debit and 
 credit accounts will be updated. </p>

<p class="body-text">Two GL entries are made for each advance payment account 
 transaction; a debit entry for which the dollar amount appears in the 
 credit amount column and a credit entry for which the dollar amount appears 
 in the debit amount column. </p>

<p class="body-text"><a href="Vendor_Management%2c_How_DIAMOND_Thinks.htm">Top</a></p>

<h1 class="calibre3"><a name="CKPRT Check Print Processing Logic"></a>CKPRT Check Print 
 Processing Logic</h1>

<p class="body-text">The check print process creates checks for advance payment 
 to vendors and evaluates accounts payable records for offsets against 
 advance payment accounts based on rules that you define in VADPY (Vendor 
 Advance Payment Account). </p>

<p class="body-text">The check print process assesses each accounts payable 
 record (created during accounts payable update) to determine if it should 
 be offset against a credit balance. The check print process also reads 
 advance payment records to determine if offsets can be applied and to 
 determine what rules govern those offsets. </p>

<p class="body-text">If a vendor has multiple advance payment accounts, the 
 check print process reads vendor master to determine which advance payment 
 account is to be offset.</p>

<p class="body-text"><a href="Vendor_Management%2c_How_DIAMOND_Thinks.htm">Top</a></p>

<h1 class="calibre3"><a name="Zero Payment Options"></a>Zero Payment Options</h1>

<p class="body-text">The check print process reads the Zero Payment Options 
 field from VADPR to determine what action to take when the credit balance 
 of an advance payment account is insufficient to cover a claim payment. 
 Claims are offset against advance payment accounts based on a first-in, 
 first-out situation and based on the priority of Advance Pay Types defined 
 in Provider Master. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}--> <!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Claims 
 should exhaust all monies for one Account Type/Payment, before offsetting 
 against another. The zero payment options are:</p>

<ul class="calibre6">
	
	<li class="kadov-p-cbullet"><p class="bullet">Remain to General Account</p></li>
	
	<li class="kadov-p-cbullet"><p class="bullet">Below Zero</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 class="calibre10">Remain to General Account</h2>

<p class="body-text">If a claim payment exceeds the credit balance of the 
 advance payment account, the claim will be paid from the general account 
 that is used for standard claims processing</p>

<h2 class="calibre10">Below Zero</h2>

<p class="body-text">If a claim payment exceeds the credit balance of the 
 advance payment account, the claim payment is held in a finalized state 
 until the will still get paid, however, the credit balance will be in 
 a negative condition. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}--> <!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->When 
 the next advance payment is applied to that account, the credit balance 
 will be brought back to a positive amount, minus the negative amount created 
 by the offsets. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}--> <!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}--></p>

<p class="body-text">When a claim payment exceeds the credit balance available 
 in the advance payment account, and the VADPR Replenish box for this account 
 is checked, the claim payment will be held in a finalized state until 
 there is enough money in the advance payment account to cover the amount 
 of the claim payment. </p>

<p class="body-text"><a href="Vendor_Management%2c_How_DIAMOND_Thinks.htm">Top</a></p>

<h1 class="calibre3"><a name="Offset By"></a>Offset By</h1>

<p class="body-text">Check print evaluates information in the Offset By field 
 of the VADPR window to help determine if an accounts payable transaction 
 should be offset against an advance payment account. The Offset By options 
 are:</p>

<ul class="calibre6">
	
	<li class="kadov-p-cbullet1"><p class="bullet1">Vendor</p></li>
	
	<li class="kadov-p-cbullet1"><p class="bullet1">Vendor + Provider</p></li>
	
	<li class="kadov-p-cbullet1"><p class="bullet1">Vendor + Provider 
 + Member</p></li>
	
	<li class="kadov-p-cbullet1"><p class="bullet1">Vendor + Member</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 class="calibre10">Vendor </h2>

<p class="body-text">All payments for the vendor you specified on the advance 
 payment account will be deducted against the credit balance as long as 
 all other rules are met. </p>

<h2 class="calibre10">Vendor + Provider </h2>

<p class="body-text">All payments that match the vendor and provider you 
 specified on the advance payment account will be deducted from the credit 
 balance if the From and Thru DOS matches and if all other rules are met. 
 If either the vendor or provider on the transaction does not match the 
 advance payment account, then the transaction is not applied. </p>

<h2 class="calibre10">Vendor + Provider + Member</h2>

<p class="body-text">All payments that match the vendor, provider, and member 
 you specified on the advance payment account will be deducted from the 
 credit balance if the From and Thru DOS matches and if all other rules 
 are met. If the vendor, provider, or member on the transaction does not 
 match the advance payment account, then the transaction is not applied.</p>

<h2 class="calibre10">Vendor + Member</h2>

<p class="body-text">All payments that match the vendor and member you specified 
 on the advance payment account will be deducted from the credit balance 
 if the From and Thru DOS matches and if all other rules are met. If either 
 the vendor or member on the transaction does not match the advance payment 
 account, then the transaction is not applied.</p>

<p class="body-text"><a href="Vendor_Management%2c_How_DIAMOND_Thinks.htm">Top</a></p>

<h1 class="calibre3"><a name="Line of Business"></a>Line of Business</h1>

<p class="body-text">For an accounts payable transaction to offset an advance 
 payment account, the line of business you specified on the advance payment 
 account must match the line of business for the provider on the claim. 
 </p>

<h1 class="calibre3"><a name="Updating_Accounts_Payable_Records"></a>Updating Accounts Payable 
 Records</h1>

<p class="body-text">When the check print process locates an accounts payable 
 transaction that matches an advance payment account, it updates the accounts 
 payable record with the check number from the advance payment. </p>

<p class="body-text"><a href="Vendor_Management%2c_How_DIAMOND_Thinks.htm">Top</a></p>

<h1 class="calibre3"><a name="1099_Processing"></a>1099 Processing</h1>

<p class="body-text">Advance Payments will be included in 1099 reporting 
 if the vendor's 1099 Flag in VENTX is set to P or Y. You can choose whether 
 or not you want offset amounts to be included in 1099s - this is controlled 
 by the Include Offsets option on the APTAX window.</p>
