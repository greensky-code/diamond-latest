            is a Pre-Existing Condition?</p>

        <p class="body-text">A pre-existing condition is a condition for which a
            member has received treatment during a specified period of time before
            becoming covered under a health plan. You can set up DIAMOND to use Pre-Existing
            Conditions logic, which manages members with pre-existing conditions.</p>

        <p class="body-text">There are two types of pre-existing conditions:</p>

        <ul class="calibre15">

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet1"><p class="bullet1">Member pre-existing conditions</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet1"><p class="bullet1">Default line of business
                pre-existing conditions</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p class="body-text">You can enter member pre-existing conditions using keyword
            MCOND (Member Conditions). For more information, see <a href="MCOND_Member_Conditions.htm">MCOND,
                Member Conditions</a>.</p>

        <p class="body-text">You can enter default line of business pre-existing
            conditions using keywords PXRUL (Pre-Existing Condition Rule) and LBPEC
            (Line of Business Pre-Existing Conditions).</p>

        <p class="body-text">Pre-Existing Conditions processing logic includes both
            types of pre-existing conditions. Pre-Existing Conditions processing logic
            is managed in the following general order:</p>

            Pre-Existing Conditions Logic Works</p>

        <p class="body-text">After completing pricing, medical definitions, and adjudication
            of a claim (Institutional, Professional Services, or Dental), DIAMOND
            logic examines keywords MELIG, GRUPD, MCOND, AND LBPEC for pre-existing
            condition data. DIAMOND logic does not examine Pre-Existing Conditions
            logic for denied claim detail lines.</p>

        <h3 class="calibre98">Institutional Claim Pre-Existing Conditions logic</h3>

        <p class="body-text">DIAMOND pre-existing conditions logic for Institutional
            claims proceeds as follows:</p>

        <p class="numbered-list">1. Evaluate the keyword MELIG <span class="calibre41">PEC</span>
            <span class="calibre41">Waived</span> check box on the member
            eligibility period corresponding to the claim. </p>

        <p class="numbered-list-indent2">If selected, do not perform Pre-existing
            Conditions logic <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}--> <!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}--></p>

        <p class="numbered-list-indent2">If cleared, perform Pre-Existing Conditions
            logic</p>

        <p class="numbered-list">2. Evaluate keyword GRUPD <span class="calibre41">Exclude
 Capitated Claim Lines</span> field for the member's group. </p>

        <p class="numbered-list-indent3">Exclude capitated claims from further Institutional
            Claim Pre-Existing Conditions logic if <span class="calibre41">Exclude
 Capitated Claim Lines</span> equals Institutional or Both. (Possible values
            for <span class="calibre41">Exclude Capitated Claim Lines</span>
            include claim types Institutional, Professional, Both (Institutional and
            Professional), or None.)</p>

        <p class="numbered-list">3. Use the <span class="calibre41">Member
 ID</span> on the claim header to locate the member's keyword MCOND member
            condition records and determine which are pre-existing conditions records.</p>

        <p class="numbered-list-indent2">If the MCOND member condition record field
            <span class="calibre41">Condition Type</span> is Pre-existing,
            Rated-up, or Ridered-out, the record is a pre-existing condition record.
            Continue with Pre-Existing Conditions logic for each such record.</p>

        <p class="numbered-list-indent2">If the MCOND member condition record field
            <span class="calibre41">Condition Type</span> is not Pre-existing,
            Rated-up, or Ridered-out, the record is not a pre-existing condition record.
            Do not include each such record in further Pre-Existing Conditions logic.</p>

        <p class="numbered-list">4. Evaluate the claim against each of the member's
            MCOND pre-existing condition records. For Institutional claims, use the
            claim header primary diagnosis code <span class="calibre41">Dx1</span>
            and <span class="calibre41">Admit</span> date as the diagnosis
            code and date of service for evaluation purposes. </p>

        <p class="numbered-list-indent">Once one matching MCOND pre-existing condition
            record is found and an MCOND <span class="calibre41">Claim Action</span>
            applied, do not evaluate the claim any further.</p>

        <p class="numbered-list-indent">a. Compare the claim header primary diagnosis
            code <span class="calibre41">Dx1</span> to the MCOND record diagnosis
            <span class="calibre41">From Value</span> through <span class="calibre41">Thru
 Value</span> diagnosis range.</p>

        <p class="numbered-list-indent2">If the claim header primary diagnosis code
            <span class="calibre41">Dx1</span> is within the MCOND record
            diagnosis <span class="calibre41">From Value</span> through <span class="calibre41">Thru Value</span>
            diagnosis range, continue
            to step 4b and evaluate the date of service. </p>

        <p class="numbered-list-indent2">If not, go to the next MCOND record for
            the member and evaluate the diagnosis code. If no more MCOND records exist
            for the member, go to step 5.</p>

        <p class="numbered-list-indent3">b. Compare the claim header <span class="calibre41">Admit</span>
            date to the MCOND effective period. The MCOND effective period is the
            MCOND <span class="calibre41">Effective Date</span> through <span class="calibre41">Term Date</span>, unless
            no <span class="calibre41">Term
 Date</span> is specified. If no MCOND <span class="calibre41">Term
 Date</span> is specified, use the MELIG <span class="calibre41">PEC
 End Date</span> from the member eligibility record corresponding to the
            claim. </p>

        <p class="numbered-list-indent2">If the claim header <span class="calibre41">Admit</span>
            date is within the MCOND record effective period, apply the MCOND record
            <span class="calibre41">Claim Action</span> (Pay, Hold, or Deny)
            and <span class="calibre41">Reason</span>, and stop. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->

        <p class="numbered-list-indent2">If the claim header <span class="calibre41">Admit</span>
            date is not within the MCOND effective period, go to STEP 4A and evaluate
            the next MCOND record for the member. If no more MCOND records exist for
            the member, go to step 5. </p>

        <p class="numbered-list">5. Identify each LBPEC record that matches the line
            of business and group of the member on the claim. </p>

        <p class="numbered-list">6. For each matching LBPEC record, use the effective
            <span class="calibre41">PEC Rule ID</span>s to identify the corresponding
            PXRUL default pre-existing condition rules. Then evaluate the claim against
            the PXRUL rules identified.</p>

        <p class="numbered-list-indent">a. Compare the claim header <span class="calibre41">Admit</span>
            date to the effective period of the <span class="calibre41">PEC

            that<span class="calibre41"> PEC Rule ID, </span>unless no Term
            Date is specified. If no LBPEC <span class="calibre41">Term Date</span>

        <p class="numbered-list-indent2">If the claim header <span class="calibre41">Admit</span>

        <p class="numbered-list-indent2">If not, go to the next <span class="calibre41">PEC

            If no more <span class="calibre41">PEC Rule ID</span>s exist
            on the current LBPEC record, go to step 6 and evaluate the next matching
            LBPEC record. If no more matching LBPEC records exist, go to step 7.</p>

        <p class="numbered-list-indent">b. Use the <span class="calibre41">PEC
 Rule ID</span> to locate the corresponding PXRUL rule. </p>

        <p class="numbered-list-indent3">c. Compare the claim header primary diagnosis
            code <span class="calibre41">Dx1</span> to the PXRUL rule diagnosis
