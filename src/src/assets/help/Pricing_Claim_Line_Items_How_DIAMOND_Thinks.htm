        <p class="body-text">Professional service claims, and in some cases institutional
            claims, are priced line-by-line. That is, as each detail line item is
            entered, DIAMOND automatically prices it as a stand-alone transaction.
            (In most cases, institutional claims are priced on a whole-claim basis.)
        </p>

        <p class="body-text">Automatic line-by-line pricing occurs when:</p>

        <p class="doc-level">1. Pricing records are established</p>

        <p class="body-text">While the PRULE record could alternatively be entered
            on the Group Detail window (GRUPD &gt; Price Rule 1) the most common set
            up is a PRULE record for each provider’s contract. The LINBS record for
            the member determines whether DIAMOND looks first for the Group Detail
            or the Provider Contract to find the price rule. In either case, if no
            price rule is found DIAMOND looks in the alternate location. </p>

        <p class="doc-level">3. As the claim is entered, each line is priced in

        <p class="body-text">In DIAMOND terminology, a Price rule (for line-by-line
            pricing) comprises of records added in keywords PRULE, PRULD, and PRULS.

        </ul>

        <p class="doc-level2"><a name="Line_by_line_Pricing_PRULD_and_PRULS_functions_MID"></a>Keywords
            PRULD and PRULS</p>

        <p class="body-text">Price Rule Detail is used to add and maintain details
            for the high-level price rule established in PRULE. Price Rule Details
            can be set up specific to procedure code modifiers. Institutional claims
            includes one modifier that you can use for pricing in this manner. Professional
            services claims include four modifier codes. However, DIAMOND uses only
            Modifier 1 in pricing and adjudication.</p>

        <p class="body-text">There are two categories of PRULD use: </p>

        <ul class="">

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h1">To define
                pricing differences within a single PRULE based on either procedure Modifier
                1or a specific calculation method.</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h1">To define
                processing rules, including reason code, default, and override values
                for each calculation method within a PRULD.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p class="body-text">PRULS specifies PRULD rules be used for particular procedure
            codes or ranges of procedure codes. This flexibility allows different
            calculation methods and processing rules to be applied depending on the
            medical service.</p>

        <p class="body-text">PRULD also includes a field called "Add to Base
            Units." This field is used when the Calculation Method is either
            "Lesser of Unit Value or Pct" or "Unit Value." The
            entry in "Add to Base Units" is added to the number of units
            DIAMOND retrieves from the UNITV record. Unit Value Type is entered on
            PRULD, and tells DIAMOND which UNITV field to retrieve: total, anesthesia,
            professional, or technical. The units retrieved are referred to as "Base
            Units."</p>

            and Calculation Logic</p>

        <p class="doc-level">How LINBS affects claim pricing: Price search order</p>

        <p class="body-text">You may use the LINBS rules to direct DIAMOND to look
            for claims pricing information in either Group/Provider order, or Provider/Group
            order.</p>

        <p class="body-text">This is useful if you are administering PPO pre-pricing
            programs, i.e. pricing claims without adjudicating them. For these kinds
            of programs, it is common for the claims pricing agreements to be defined
            by employer groups rather than individual provider contracts. In these
            kinds of programs, you can select ‘Group’ as the value in the Primary
            Price Search Info field. </p>

        <p class="body-text">In most managed care programs, however, pricing is governed
            by individual provider contracts. In these cases, you can select ‘Provider’
            as the value in the Primary Price Search Info field.</p>

        <p class="body-text">In both cases note that the entry in the Primary Price
            Search Info field determines the <span class="calibre25">order</span>
            in which DIAMOND looks for pricing rules, not the <span class="calibre25">only</span>
            place DIAMOND looks. Therefore, in both cases, the <span class="calibre25">last</span>
            pricing information found will govern. If ‘Group’ is the first place DIAMOND
            looks, PROVC is the second place searched and data found in PROVC will
            be used. If ‘Provider’ is the first place DIAMOND looks, GRUPD is the
            second place searched and data found in GRUPD will be used. </p>

        <p class="body-text">In all cases, PROCP (the pricing record specific to
            a procedure code) is the last place DIAMOND looks and is the final override
            of any pricing information; Contract type, % Billed, % Allowed, and Withhold
            %, from either the provider contract, PROVC, or the group detail, GRUPD.
            Therefore, if you want to use these fields as found on GRUPD or PROVC,
            make sure DIAMOND points to PROCP records with these fields blank.</p>

        <p class="doc-level2"><a
                name="Line_by_line_Pricing_How_DIAMOND_finds_price_rule_details:_Search_sequences_and_levels_MID"></a>How
            DIAMOND finds Price rule details: Search sequences and levels</p>

        <p class="body-text">Keyword PRULD contains the inputs to the pricing calculation.
            Different pricing calculations apply to different modifier values, and
            therefore DIAMOND first looks at the "Modifier 1" field to identify
            whether the PRULD record applies to the claim line. (Of the four Modifier
            codes on the professional services claim detail line, DIAMOND only uses
            Modifier 1 in pricing and adjudication. Institutional claims include only
            the Modifier 1 field.) Typically, for example, different calculations
            are required to price a surgery claim than those required to price the
            anesthesia for that surgery. Modifier 1 of the surgical procedure code
            that indicates anesthesia tells DIAMOND to look for the calculation method
            on a PRULD with the anesthesia modifier. For more information on pricing
            anesthesia time, see <a href="Pricing_Anesthesia_Time_How_DIAMOND_Thinks.htm">Pricing
                Anesthesia Time, How DIAMOND Thinks</a>. </p>

        <p class="body-text">Beyond differences due to modifiers, you may have pricing
            schemes that require different calculation methods for different claim
            situations. These different calculations are recorded in Price Rule Details
            (PRULD), and DIAMOND must find the correct method for each detail claim
            line depending on the claim situation. DIAMOND uses a fall-through logic
            to search for the correct (matching) PRULD record, reading through the
            records and stopping as soon as it comes to a match. Because DIAMOND searches
            through the methods in the order you specify, you can define the order
            to ensure DIAMOND will come to the correct rule, stop, and select it.
        </p>

        <p class="body-text">To define this search order for PRULD records, you associate
            a Search Level and at least one sequence number to each record. (Note
            in DIAMOND terminology, Search Levels are often referred to as "calculation
            methods.") You may have up to five search levels, and hundreds of
            sequences within each level. Because DIAMOND will search until it finds
            a matching rule, stop searching and apply that rule, you must make sure
            that specific rules fall in order before more general rules. </p>

        <p class="body-text">Multiple sequence numbers are used when different<span
                class="calibre25"> </span>pricing<span class="calibre25">
 </span>characteristics apply to different procedure codes for the same
            calculation method (level). For example, calculation method sequence 1
            can refer to general surgery, and sequence 2 can refer to organ transplants.
            To distinguish these different procedures a PRULS record is used to define
            the procedure code range or ranges to which the PRULD record applies.
        </p>

        <p class="body-text">DIAMOND searches within each level in numeric sequence
            number order, and then moves to the next highest level, e.g. level 1/sequence
            1, level 1/ sequence 2, level 2/sequence 1, level 2/sequence 2, and so
            forth. Therefore, use level 1/sequence 1 to define the method which applies
            to the most specific circumstance. Use levels 2 - 5 and their associated
