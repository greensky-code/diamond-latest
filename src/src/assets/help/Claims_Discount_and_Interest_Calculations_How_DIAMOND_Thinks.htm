        <p class="body-text">The claims discount calculation, claims penalty, and
            claims interest calculation functionality provides you the option to automatically
            calculate discount, penalty, or interest payments against payable and
            reversed payable claims.</p>

        <p class="body-text">Claim discounts are typically based on negotiated arrangements
            with providers. Some arrangements may allow for your organization to apply
            discounts against claim payments that are made in a timely manner (for
            example, within a time frame specified in a provider contract); these
            types of arrangements are sometimes called prompt payment discounts. Conversely,
            your organization may be required to pay a penalty amount, or interest,
            for claims that are paid late. You can set up rules at the line of business
            level that automatically calculate discount, penalty or interest amounts
            for payable claim detail lines. DIAMOND provides a manual process for
            you to apply discount, penalty, or interest amounts against adjusted lines.
        </p>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h1"><p class="bullet-list-h1">Discount
                and interest calculations are applied only to payable (including reversed
                payable) claim detail lines. Discount and interest calculations are not
                applied against informational lines that are created during whole claim
                pricing, or against capitated lines or staff lines. </p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h1"><p class="bullet-list-h1">Discount
                and interest calculations are system calculated based on the discount
                and interest calculation rules your organization defines. The calculated
                discount and interest amounts cannot be manually entered, changed, or
                deleted.</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h1"><p class="bullet-list-h1">Discount
                and interest amounts are calculated during the check print process against
                the claim’s net amount. The new amount (net amount less discount or plus
                interest) is stored in the Paid Net Amt field.</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h1"><p class="bullet-list-h1">Discount
                and interest calculations are based on calendar days; no consideration

                period of time from the Calculation Date (Received Date, Reset Date, or
                Interest Inquiry Date) to the payment date spans two sets of discount
                or interest rates, DIAMOND uses the rate in effect at the payment date.</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h1"><p class="bullet-list-h1">A single
                claim detail line cannot have both a discount amount and an interest amount
                applied. If you set your system to evaluate for both discount and interest,
                DIAMOND evaluates the discount calculation rules first. </p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h1"><p class="bullet-list-h1">For each
                line of business, you determine if you want to calculate discount, interest,
                both discount and interest, or neither (the default is neither). If you
                set a line of business to calculate both discount and interest, DIAMOND
                will first evaluate discount rules. If a rule is found, then DIAMOND will
                apply that rule and stop searching, if no discount rule is found, or if
                the discount calculated is 0, then DIAMOND will evaluate the interest
                rules to see if any are applicable. </p></li>

                (Line of Business) screen includes a separate check box called Pay Sub/Dep.
                This field allows you to select a different setting for claims that are
                paid directly to subscribers or dependents; for example, a line of business
                could be set to evaluate both discount and interest calculation rules
                for vendor payments, while payments for the same line of business payable
                to the subscriber or dependent can be set so that they do not evaluate
                either discount or interest calculation rules.</p></li>

            Calculations</p>

        <p class="body-text">Discounts can be applied against payable claim lines
            and reversed payable claim lines. Discounts are based on the number of
            days it takes to pay a claim. The discount amount is based on the percentage
            defined in the discount calculation rule; the percentage rate is multiplied
            against the Net Amount to determine the actual discount amount that will
            be subtracted from the claim payment. Discounts are calculated at the
            time of payment. </p>

        <p class="body-text">If a claim detail line is held for any reason prior
            to the line being resolved and paid, the hold reason code will not impact
            the discount amount applied. You cannot set a minimum amount for discount
            payments; therefore, a discount can be as small as $0.01. </p>

        <p class="body-text">Applying a discount to an adjusted line is a manual
            process. For more information, see <a

            the rule. Discount calculation rules are evaluated in order from lowest
            number to highest number. DIAMOND stops searching as soon as it finds
            a rule that matches the information on the claim line; therefore, the
            more specific rules should have lower Rule Order numbers, while the more
            general rules should have higher Rule Order numbers. </p>

        <p class="doc-level2">Effective Date</p>

            for a discount. </p>

        <p class="doc-level2">Discount Rate</p>

        <p class="body-text">Discount Rate is the percentage rate for the discount.
            This percentage is multiplied against the Net Amt of the claim to determine
            the actual discount. The discount amount is subtracted from the Net Amt
            to create the Paid Net Amt which is the amount that will appear on the
            check or the EFT payment.</p>

        <p class="doc-level2">Search Sequences </p>

        <p class="body-text">Each rule must have at least one search sequence and

            From value for the Primary Determinant. </p>

        <p class="body-text">Each search sequence has a number (Search Seq) that
            determines the order in which the search sequence is evaluated; sequences
            are evaluated in numerical order, from lowest number to highest. </p>

        <p class="body-text">If a rule has two or more search sequences, only claims
            that match the criterion of all search sequences will match the discount
            calculation rule.</p>

        <p class="doc-level1">Calculating the Discount Amount</p>

        <p class="body-text">DIAMOND first calculates the number of days it took
            to pay the claim by subtracting the claim’s Received Date from the date
            the claim line was paid (either the Check Date or EFT Date). Then DIAMOND
            compares the days-to-pay against the Discount Days from the discount calculation
            rule. DIAMOND applies the discount only if the days-to-pay is less than
            or equal to the Discount Days.</p>

        <p class="body-text">If DIAMOND determines that the claim is eligible for
            a discount, then the discount is calculated by multiplying the Discount
            Rate against the Net Amt of the claim line. The resulting discount amount
            is subtracted from the Net Amt creating the Paid Net Amt. The Paid Net
            Amount is the amount that will be paid on the check or EFT transaction.</p>

            or a penalty that is a percentage of the net claim amount. Penalties can
            be also applied manually. By manually entering a negative penalty amount

        <p class="body-text">The Reset Claim Indicator is a Special menu command
            available from the claim detail screen that enables you to switch a claim’s
            Unclean Indicator from yes to no or from no to yes. Changing the Unclean
            Indicator from yes to no only affects the claim going forward, it does

        <p class="body-text">There are two ways you can affect the number of unclean

            If you want to use either of these options, you must fill in the fields
            prior to running APUPD and check print. </p>

        <p class="doc-level2">Override all Unclean Days</p>

        <p class="body-text">Selecting this field erases any unclean days that have

        <p class="doc-level2">Deduct Some Unclean Days</p>

        <p class="body-text">This field enables you to subtract some of the unclean

            Unclean Indicator </p>

        <p class="body-text">The Apply Unclean Indicator is an option you set at
            the line of business to determine how DIAMOND applies the Unclean Indicator
            on claim detail lines. There are two options; you can select to have all
            claim detail lines set to unclean if one claim detail is unclean, or you
            can select to have each claim detail line evaluated separately. The default
            is to set all claim detail lines to unclean if one claim detail line is

        <p class="body-text">The Interest Calculation Date is the date that is used
            as the From Date in interest calculations. There are three dates you can
            use as the Calculation Date:</p>

        <ul class="calibre2">

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h1"><p class="bullet-list-h1">Received

        </ul>

        <p class="doc-level1">Received Date</p>

        <p class="body-text">The default is to use the claim’s Received Date as the
            calculation date. </p>

        <p class="doc-level1">Reset Date</p>

        <p class="body-text">Each claim detail line includes a Reset Date field.
            If you want to use the reset date in the interest calculation instead
            of the received date, you must select the Use Reset Date check box on
            LINBS. DIAMOND uses the Reset Date as the From Date in the interest calculations
            when the following criteria are met: the Reset Date check box on LINBS
            is checked, the Reset Date field on the claim detail line is filled in,
            and an interest calculation is applied. If the line of business record
            specifies to use the Reset Date, but the reset date field on the claim
            line is blank, DIAMOND uses the Received Date in the interest calculation.</p>

        <p class="doc-level1">Inquiry Date</p>

        <p class="body-text">If an Interest Inquiry Date is provided, it takes precedence
            regardless of whether or not the Use Reset date is selected on the line
            of business. The Interest Inquiry Date is set on the Special menu command,
            Claims Interest/Discount Information. This Special menu command is available
