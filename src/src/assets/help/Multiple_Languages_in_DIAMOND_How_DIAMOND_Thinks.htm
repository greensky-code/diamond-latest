        <h2 class="calibre20"><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

        <p class="text">You can display screen names, menus, field labels, and user
            messages in multiple languages. In your implementation you may have everything
            in a single language other than American English, or you may have different
            languages for different users, e.g. some claims processors working in
            Spanish, some in American English, and others in Portuguese.</p>

        <p class="text">The technical term for the system capabilities that make
            multiple languages possible is "tokenization," because each
            individual item of text that may be modified, such as a field label or
            processing message, is called a token.</p>

        <p class="text">Naturally, the more languages you employ the more complex
            the set up and management of your implementation. However, the steps used
            to create a single alternate language are the same as for many alternates,
            so, for example, once you have set up Spanish setting up French is a straightforward
            process.</p>

        <h2 class="calibre20"><a name="Multiple_Languages_in_DIAMOND_DIAMOND_s_Base_Language_MID"></a>DIAMOND’s
            Base Language</h2>

        <p class="text">DIAMOND is delivered with American English as its base language.
            It displays as AMERI in keyword LANGM (Language), where language codes
            are set up. You will see it elsewhere with a code of 0 (zero) and AMERI
            as the description.</p>

        <p class="text">There is no user access to the entries in AMERI for screen
            names, field literals, messages, and other text. They cannot be changed.
            To change DIAMOND’s text to different phrasing, but still in American
            English, set up a new language code and enter your text changes for that
            new code. For example, you could establish a language code ENGLI, for
            this purpose.</p>

        <h2 class="calibre20"><a name="Multiple_Languages_in_DIAMOND_Default_Language_and_Base_Language_MID"></a>Default
            Language and Base Language</h2>

        <p class="text">When DIAMOND is delivered, the de facto default language
            is the same as the base language, 0. Entries in the base language are
            in American English. When you change the default from American English
            to another language, that new default language becomes the base language.
            This is only important in the setting up of subsequent languages; the
            base language is the text from which the new language text is created.
            For example, when you go to MNUMT and retrieve menu entries (in the left
            hand box), they will be the entries for the base language; American English,
            unless you have changed the default to another language, in which case
            they will be the entries for that other language, the new base.</p>

        <p class="text">The default language is changed in LANGM. When it is changed
            DIAMOND automatically assigns the new default language to every user (in
            SUSER), and you may override individual users who will use a language
            other than the default. Make sure you do not change the default language
            until the new default is fully defined. Otherwise, the automatic assignment
            to users in SUSER to an incompletely defined language will cause unpredictable
            results when those users attempt to sign on.</p>

        <h2 class="calibre20"><a name="Multiple_Languages_in_DIAMOND_Different_Languages_for_Different_Users_MID"></a>Different
            Languages for Different Users</h2>

        <p class="text">Once you have set up language codes in keyword LANGM you
            may assign them to individual users by overriding the default language.
            The base language, 0, AMERI, is available, as are all the alternate language
            codes you have established. To activate the use of an alternate language,
            you must establish the code in LANGM and set up associated records in
            LOVMT, MNUMT, KWDMT, SCNMT, UDTXT, and MSGMT, and then assign the alternate
            to users in SUSER. In order for the new language to ‘make sense’ you will
            likely need new entries for CODES, UDATT, and NAVMT, although DIAMOND
            does not require these.</p>

        <p class="text">For example, if you are setting DIAMOND up to handle both
            Spanish and English because your health plan operates near the border
            with Mexico, you will want to enable the address field Country in UDATT
            to distinguish between addresses in the US and those in Mexico. You will
            also want to establish user defined code values in CODES for Spanish users.
            However, if you are setting up an English version to replace the American
            English version, you may not require Country to be part of DIAMOND addresses,
            nor are the values for user defined codes (in CODES) or menu names (in
            NAVMT) any different in the new English version. Therefore, you need not
            set up CODES, NAVMT, or UDATT for the alternate language English.</p>

        <p class="text">DIAMOND will not allow you to assign a user to a language
            code that has not been completely established. The language field in SUSER
            will not accept an incompletely defined value.</p>

        </ul>

        <h3 class="calibre2">A note about SCNMT</h3>

        <p class="text">SCNMT contains all the hard-code field names and associated
            microhelp for every DIAMOND screen. When you first request a language
            which has not been set up in SCNMT, DIAMOND will create screens and microhelp
            entries (from the base) associated with the new language for every DIAMOND
            screen. This takes several minutes or longer. However, once these are
            created you can make changes as you wish and at your leisure.</p>

        <p class="text">However, there are hundreds of screens, fields, and microhelp
            entries, and it may be easier to use a back-end database tool to make
            the changes in SCNMT for an alternate language. </p>
