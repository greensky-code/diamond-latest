        <p class="text">DIAMOND logic supports two types of member conditions:</p>

        <ul class="calibre15">

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet1"><p class="bullet1">Privacy - a keyword MCOND

                a keyword MCOND member <span class="calibre41">Condition Type</span>

                condition" functionality</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text">Each type of member condition enables you to trigger special
            processing logic for claims and authorizations that include a diagnosis
            code and claim effective dates that reflect a specific member condition.</p>

        <h2 class="calibre97">Privacy by Diagnosis functionality</h2>

        <p class="text">Member conditions privacy by diagnosis functionality enables
            you to do the following:</p>

        <ul class="calibre15">

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet1"><p class="bullet1">Define member condition rules

                based on diagnosis codes and effective periods. They also specify when
                privacy applies to authorizations based on effective periods alone.</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet1"><p class="bullet1">Use member condition rules
                to flag claims for privacy when they include a diagnosis code and effective

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet1"><p class="bullet1">Use member condition rules
                to flag authorizations for possible privacy when they include an effective
                period reflecting a possible member condition of privacy.</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet1"><p class="bullet1">Define a privacy address

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet1"><p class="bullet1">Use the privacy address for
                claims designated as Pay to Subscriber or Pay to Dependent under certain

                when member pre-existing conditions logic applies to claims based on diagnosis
                codes and effective periods.</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet1"><p class="bullet1">For Institutional claims,
                use member condition rules to pay, hold, or deny entire claims when they

                of pre-existing condition. </p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet1"><p class="bullet1">For Professional Services
                and Dental claims, use member condition rules to pay, hold, or deny individual
