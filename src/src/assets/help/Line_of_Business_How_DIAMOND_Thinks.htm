        <p class="text">The line of business record can be used to categorize different
            products offered by a health plan. Or, because of the variety of attributes
            that can be associated with a line of business code, keyword LINBS can
            distinguish different kinds of products according to how providers, payees,
            claims, and members are handled. </p>

        <p class="text">This document explains the options you have for governing
            processing depending on the line of business.</p>

            LINBS Affects Claim Pricing</h2>

        <h3 class="calibre2">Allowed Amount Versus Billed Amount Edits</h3>

        <p class="text">While in institutional claims the allowed amount can at times
            be greater than the billed amount (per diem is one example), this is not
            generally allowed for professional services or dental services claims.
            If a line of business does allow this for professional services or dental
            services claims, you may permit it with an entry in the Allowed &gt; Billed
            field.</p>

        <p class="text">If you select this check box, when professional services
            or dental services claims associated with this line of business are priced,
            DIAMOND processing determines the allowed amount and does not lower the
            allowed amount to equal the billed amount if billed is less than allowed.</p>

        <p class="text">At the line of business, you can set if you want to automatically
            calculate discounts, interest, both discounts and interest, or neither,
            for payable and reversed payable claim lines.</p>

        <p class="text">For a complete explanation of claims discount and interest

            LINBS Affects Authorization/Claim Matching</h2>

        <p class="text">The line of business record determines whether or not DIAMOND
            processing attempts to automatically match authorizations to claims during
            claims processing. In other words, the line of business record enables
            this feature. However, there are many parameters and rules required to
            enable authorization/claims matching to work. See <a
                    href="Claims.chm::/Authorization_Claim_Links_How_DIAMOND_Thinks.htm">Authorization
                Claim Links, How DIAMOND Thinks</a>, which includes references to the
            other keywords and functions necessary to enable this functionality.</p>

        <p class="text">There are several entries in keyword LINBS that, in combination,
            enable and govern some aspects authorizations/claims matching. They are
            Auth/Claim Match, Days Before, Days After, Covering Prov, and Waive Match
            Order. For specific entries and definitions, see <a href="LINBS_Field_Definitions.htm">LINBS
                Field Definitions</a>.</p>

        <p class="text">The Auth/Claim Match field has three functions.</p>

        <ol class="calibre3">

            <li class="kadov-p-cstep"><p class="step">It enables the authorization/claims
                matching feature, both for the initial claims processing and the Authorization
                Match/Waive command on the menu bar in keywords DNCLM, INCLM, and PSCLM.
            </p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cstep"><p class="step">It turns the same feature for
                covering providers, if you want to have DIAMOND processing match authorizations
                to services rendered by covering providers on behalf of the original authorized
                provider. To enable this feature, both this field and the Covering Prov
                field must be selected. </p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cstep"><p class="step">It enables you to use the ‘days
                before’ and ‘days after’ feature used by keyword ARULE, the authorization/claims
                matching rules.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <p class="text">The Days After and Days Before fields have two functions.</p>

        <ol class="calibre3">

            <li class="kadov-p-cstep"><p class="step">They define the acceptable date
                range outside of which a claim is considered "outside the authorized
                date," leading to the claim action specified in keyword ARULE.</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cstep"><p class="step">They define the acceptable date
                range in the same way for covering providers.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <p class="text">In both cases and for both Days After and Days Before, the
            number of days entered is attached to the primary date of service on the
            claim (PSCLM, the Svc Date on the header window; INCLM, the Admit Date
            on the header window). If the request date on the authorization is within
            the calculated range, it is a potentially valid authorization for the
            subject claim and is eligible for matching.</p>

        <p class="text"><span class="calibre4">Important Note</span>  The
            VENDORFIRST parameter logic cannot be used if you select the Covering
            Prov check box (the VENDORFIRST Parameter 1 must be "blank.")</p>

        <h2 class="calibre20"><a
                name="How_Line_of_Business_Controls_Processing_Subscriber_dependent_eligibility_consistency_MID"></a>Subscriber/Dependent
            Eligibility Consistency</h2>

        <p class="text">You can relax the standard edits DIAMOND processing uses
            to make sure that dependents cannot have eligibility and benefits which
            are outside of or different from the subscribers. In most commercial health
            plans, this consistency is critical. In some situations and programs (e.g.
            Medicaid, often) the eligibility of dependents can be different from that
            of the head of household or subscriber. Therefore, by line of business
            you may choose to eliminate this editing.</p>

        <p class="text">When consistency tests are enforced, <span class="calibre40">DIAMOND</span>
            processing requires that all dependents must be enrolled in the same group
            and plan as the subscriber. In addition, the dependents’ effective and
            termination dates must fall within the eligibility period of the subscriber;
            i.e., dependents are eligible for coverage based on the subscriber’s eligibility
            dates and the dependents will<span class="calibre41"> </span>not
            be eligible after the subscriber is terminated.</p>

        <p class="text">If you choose to relax the edits, consistency tests are not<span class="calibre41"> </span>enforced.
            In addition, be aware that:</p>

        <ul class="calibre17">

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet"><p class="bullet">Keyword GPBIL (Premium Billing)
                cannot be used for this line of business, since billing logic assumes
                that all members of a family are enrolled in the same benefit plan and
                that the eligibility periods of the dependents always fall within the
                eligibility period of the subscriber.</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet"><p class="bullet">Family unit-oriented benefit
                rules (such a family deductibles) cannot<span class="calibre41">
 </span>be used for this line of business.</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet"><p class="bullet">The <span class="calibre4">Member
 Address Ripple</span> command on the <span class="calibre4">Special</span>
                menu in keyword MEMBR cannot be used for this line of business.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="calibre20"><a
                name="How_Line_of_Business_Controls_Processing_A_note_on_EOBs_for_ineligible_members_MID"></a>EOBs
            for Ineligible Members</h2>

        <p class="text">You may enter a rule in keyword LINBS to print EOBs. An exception
            to this rule for claims processed online is when a member is determined
            to be ineligible. When this happens, DIAMOND processing uses the DFLTPRINTSTAT
            parameters to decide whether to print an EOB. </p>

        <h2 class="calibre20"><a name="How_Line_of_Business_Controls_Processing_Default_Provider_Logic_MID"></a>Default
            Provider Logic</h2>

        <p class="text">Keyword PROVC (Provider Contracts) maintains the data that
            defines the contractual relationship between the healthcare organization
            and the healthcare provider. During claims processing, <span class="calibre40">DIAMOND</span>
            processing must determine a relationship between the rendering provider
            and the member. To do this, <span class="calibre40">DIAMOND</span>
            processing uses provider contract search logic and the associated line
            of business contract search criteria sets to "match" a provider’s
            contract to the member.</p>

        <p class="text">Instead of creating and managing unique contract records
            for each provider, line of business, IPA, and panel combination, it may
            be more efficient to create and manage only the very specific relationships
            of a provider to line(s) of business, IPA(s), and panel(s), using more
            general contracts shared by many providers who have the same relationship
            with the healthcare organization. This approach can significantly reduce
            the number of contract records you must enter and maintain.</p>
