            Batch</h2>

        <p class="text">When you first display keyword INCLM, the Claims Batch Initiation
            dialog box displays. It allows you to type a default claim batch number
            and received date to use as long as you remain in keyword INCLM. Both
            fields are optional. If you do not enter default values, then during claims
            entry, the Batch Number box will be blank and the Date Received box will
            display the current (system) date. If necessary, you can type over the
            displayed batch number and received date. You also can change the defaults
            at any time from the Institutional Claims header window using the Change
            Default Batch command on the Special menu.</p>

        <h3 class="calibre4">Header/Detail/UB92 order:</h3>

        <p class="text">After you finished entering information in the Institutional
            Claims header window, either the UB92 window or the Institutional Claims
            detail window displays. It depends on the INCLM Order selection on the
            line of business for the claim. See LINBS and INCLM Order User Documentation
            for additional information.</p>

        <p class="text">If DIAMOND does not find a line of business for the claim,
            then the UB92 or claim detail display order is determined by the INCLMUB92
            parameter. See PARAM, INCLMUB92 User Documentation for additional information.</p>

        <p class="text">If the UB92 window is displayed next, then DIAMOND returns
            you to the claim detail window after you enter the UB92 data. If the claim
            detail window is displayed next, then you must use the UB92 command on
            the Topic menu.</p>

        <h3 class="calibre4">Saving a detail line item</h3>

        <p class="text">When you save a claim detail line item, DIAMOND compares
            the Adj Method on the claim detail line to the member’s associated group
            price/adjudication requirement. If the member’s group pricing is set to
            adjudicate (in keyword GRUPD, the Group Req list is set to A – Adjud),
            then you must adjudicate the line item before you save it.</p>

        <p class="text">For more information, see <a href="Members.chm::/GRUPD_Group_Detail.htm">GRUPD,
            Group Detail</a>. </p>

        <h2 class="calibre3"><a name="INCLM_Determining_Claim_Eligibility_MID"></a>Determining Claim
            Eligibility</h2>

        <h3 class="calibre4">How DIAMOND determines claim eligibility</h3>

        <p class="text">First, DIAMOND uses the admission date (Adm Date box) on
            the Institutional Claims Header window to determine eligibility. However,
            if a discharge date (Disch Date box) is entered, then DIAMOND verifies
            the member’s eligibility based on the admission date and the discharge
            date. A warning displays if the member is ineligible or if the member’s
            eligibility expired before the discharge date.</p>

        <p class="text">If DIAMOND determines the claim is eligible, then it next
            performs checks for Coordination of Benefits (COB), student dependent
            status, and pre-existing conditions. <span class="calibre156">DIAMOND</span>
            displays a warning message if exceptions to eligibility are found. </p>

        <p class="text">Also, during adjudication DIAMOND validates that the date
            of service (Date box) falls within the date range of one of the member’s
            eligibility periods. If it does not, then the line item is denied. DIAMOND
            sets the Claim Status list to D - Denied, sets the Allowed Amt and Total
            Not Cov boxes to $0.00, and assigns the Reason code associated with reason
            code type ME as the Not Cov Rsn code. Reason code type ME (only one is
            allowed) must exist in keyword REASN.</p>

        <h3 class="calibre4">What happens when a claim is ineligible</h3>

        <p class="text">If the member is ineligible, the claim date of service is
            outside of their eligibility period, then the claim is denied. If the
            eligibility status on the member record is invalid because it does not
            match the valid codes stored in the ELIGSTAT parameter, then the claim
            is held</p>

        <p class="text">There are additional methods that can automatically hold
            a claim. For more information, see <a href="Claim_Holds_How_DIAMOND_Thinks_HDT.htm">Claim
                Holds, How DIAMOND Thinks</a>. </p>

        <p class="text">You can manually price, adjudicate, or expense an institutional
            claim when a member is outside an eligibility period. However, because
            there is no group/plan information on the claim header DIAMOND cannot
            validate the Group Req. indicator to set the appropriate flag on the Pre_Price_Only
            column, the claim detail line items will not be finalized.</p>

        <h3 class="calibre4">Eligibility changes after a claim is processed</h3>

        <p class="text">DIAMOND takes a "snapshot" of the member’s benefit
            package/plan/rule(s) to be used during the claim adjudication process
            as soon as the member identification is displayed. If the associated benefit
            package/plan/rules (BENEF, BRULE) are changed after the benefits snapshot,
            then the benefit changes are not immediately updated on the still open
            claim header window and DIAMOND uses the benefit snapshot (old benefit
            data) if the claim is adjudicated during the session. However, the updated
            benefit data will display when you exit and then re-open the claim. If
            the claim was adjudicated using old benefits (snapshot) data, then on
            the Special menu, point to Pricing and Adjudication, and then click Adjudicate
            Claim to re-adjudicate the claim to include the updated (changed) benefit
            data.</p>

        <h2 class="calibre3"><a name="INCLM_Checking_for_Duplicate_Claims_MID"></a>Checking for Duplicate
            Claims</h2>

        <p class="text">Each time a claim is entered, DIAMOND automatically checks
            for duplicate claims based on the duplicate checking criteria set up for
            the line of business associated with the claim. See Line of Business (LINBS)
            Claim Duplicate Rule field definition and Claim Duplicate Check Rules
            (DUPRL) User Documentation for additional information.</p>

        <p class="text"><a href="Institutional_Claims_Processing_How_DIAMOND_Thinks.htm">Top</a></p>

        <h2 class="calibre3"><a name="INCLM_About_Pricing_MID"></a>About Pricing </h2>

        <p class="text">Each claim detail line item can be priced (allowed amount
            calculation only) or fully adjudicated. The Group Req list in keyword
            GRUPD (Group Detail) controls whether claims for a group are priced or
            fully adjudicated.</p>

        <p class="text">Automatic pricing of claim detail lines can be based on fee
            schedules, percentages of billed charges, conversion factors, per-diems,
            diagnostic-related groups, or a combination of methods. Automatic pricing
            can be driven by the group contract, the provider contract, a specific
            procedure code, or a combination of these factors.</p>

        <p class="text">You can also manually price a claim detail line by overriding
            the calculated Allowed Amount for either a new claim detail line or any
            existing unfinalized detail line. For more information, see <a
                    href="Pricing.chm::/Manually_Pricing_a_Claim_Detail_Line.htm">Manually
                Pricing a Claim Detail Line</a>.</p>

        <h3 class="calibre4">Diagnosis-Related Grouping (DRG) codes</h3>

        <p class="text">If your organization is using external DRG grouping software,
            then you can leave the DRG field on the claim header blank. When you move
            to the Institutional Claims detail window, the external grouping software
            will return a DRG code to this field. (This field is also displayed on
            the claim detail window.) You can type over the displayed DRG code or
            you can enter/correct DRG related data on the claim header and re-group
            by selecting the DRG command on the Special menu. For more information,
            see keyword <a href="Pricing.chm::/DRGCD_DRG_Codes.htm">DRGGP (DRG Grouper/Pricer
                Maintenance)</a>.</p>

        <h3 class="calibre4">Alternate (or ‘target’) revenue and CPT4/HCPCS codes</h3>

        <p class="text">There are instances in institutional claims in which a revenue
            code is associated with a CPT code, and both must be entered on a claim
            detail line item if the line is to be priced accurately. In the detail
            procedure code record, keyword PROCD, if the Price Indicator check box
            is selected, then a claim uses an alternate Procedure code to price a
            claim detail line item instead of the revenue code. The Procedure Determinant
            (on the Special menu in keyword PROCD) stores CPT4/HCPCS codes that are
            valid alternates for each revenue code. </p>

        <p class="text">If you want INCLM to edit the entry of alternate codes to
            make sure they are valid for the entered revenue code, you must turn this
            feature ‘on’ in LINBS with an entry in the Target Rev Code Edit field.
            If the CPT4/HCPCS code entered is not valid for the entered revenue code,
            the Action and Reason fields on LINBS are invoked. </p>

        <p class="text">If the PROCD &gt; Price on Alt Proc Cde check box has been
            selected for the procedure code you enter in the INCLM, Claim Detail &gt;
            Alt Proc field, DIAMOND prices the claim detail line based on the alternate
            procedure (Alt Proc) entered rather than the procedure code (Proc) entered.
            See PROCD, Price on Alt Proc Cde User Documentation for additional information.</p>

        <p class="text">See Procedure Code (PROCD) documentation for additional information
            on how to create targeted revenue codes and their associated alternate
            procedure codes (PROCD &gt; Target Revenue Code; PROCD &gt; Price on Alt
            Proc Cde; PROCD, Special menu &gt; Valid Alternate Procedure Codes).</p>

        <p class="text"><a href="Institutional_Claims_Processing_How_DIAMOND_Thinks.htm">Top</a></p>

        <h2 class="calibre3"><a name="INCLM_About_Adjudication_MID"></a>About Adjudication</h2>

        <p class="text">Adjudication is the process in which benefit rules, determined
            by a member’s benefit package, are applied to the claim detail line. This
            results in the calculation of deductibles, not-covered amounts, co-payments,
            coinsurance, and exclusions which may reduce the amount paid to the provider.
            When a claim is adjudicated, each claim detail line is both priced (an
            allowed amount is calculated) and adjudicated (benefit rules are applied).
            See Benefit Package (BENEF), Benefit Rule (BRULE), and Group Detail (GRUPD)
            User Documentation for additional information.</p>

        <p class="text">As part of the adjudication process, DIAMOND includes Coordination
            of Benefits (COB) processing when applicable. See Coordination of Benefits
            Overview and related topics for more information on COB.</p>

        <h3 class="calibre4">Calculating the Net Amount</h3>

        <p class="text">DIAMOND calculates the claim detail line Net Amount differently
            depending on whether the line is automatically or manually adjudicated,
            and whether a COB calculation method applies.</p>

        <ol class="calibre20">

            <li class="kadov-p-cstep"><p class="step1">When DIAMOND automatically adjudicates
                a claim line and no COB<span class="calibre5"> </span>applies:</p></li>
        </ol>

        <p class="stepcont">Net Amount = Allowed Amt - Total Not Cov - Total Copay
            - Total Coins - Total Deduct - Pt Liability amounts for Benefit Rule type
            99 (Other) - Withhold Amt</p>

        <p class="stepcont">In some cases, the sum total of the Withhold Amt and
            the patient liabilities (including not covered amounts) may be greater
            than the Allowed Amt. In these situations, rather than placing a negative
            dollar amount in the Net Amount field, DIAMOND sets the Net Amount field
            to 0 and stores the overage figure in the Withhold Surplus field.</p>

        <p class="stepcont">The Total Co-ins amount is the sum of all calculated
            coinsurance amounts. DIAMOND calculates each coinsurance amount as the
            benefit rule coinsurance percentage (BRULE Coinsure %) times the claim
            detail line allowed amount net of any other benefit rules applied before
            the current coinsurance rule. (You set the processing order for benefit
            rules in each benefit package.) That is, DIAMOND calculates coinsurance
            on a decreasing total based on the application of any prior ordered benefit
            rules.</p>

        <p class="stepcont">Example:</p>

        <p class="stepcont">Allowed Amount = 200.00</p>

        <p class="stepcont">Benefit Rules in processing order: </p>

        <p class="stepcont">1. Copay = 10.00</p>

        <p class="stepcont">2. Deductible = 50.00</p>

        <p class="stepcont">3. Coinsurance1 = 20%</p>

        <p class="stepcont">4. Coinsurance2 = 10%</p>

        <p class="stepcont">Coinsurance1 and Coinsurance2 amounts are calculated
            as follows:</p>

        <p class="stepcont">200.00 (Allowed Amount) - 10.00 (Copay) = 190.00</p>

        <p class="stepcont">190.00 - 50.00 (Deductible) = 140.00</p>

        <p class="stepcont">140.00 x 20% (Coinsurance1) = 28.00</p>

        <p class="stepcont">140.00 - 28.00 = 112.00</p>

        <p class="stepcont">112.00 x 10% (Coinsurance2) = 11.20</p>

        <p class="stepcont">112.00 - 11.20 = 100.80</p>

        </ol>

        <p class="stepcont">DIAMOND performs the specific calculation logic of that

            methods.</p>

        <p class="stepcont"><span class="calibre5">Note:</span> <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}--> 
            <!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}--> For
            a COB claim that is automatically adjudicated, if the provider on the
            claim has a contract that includes a provider withhold amount, DIAMOND
            does not include this amount in COB and Net Amount calculations. DIAMOND
            does still display the Provider withhold amount on the claim line.</p>

            than the Allowed Amt. In these situations, rather than placing a negative
            dollar amount in the Net Amount field, DIAMOND sets the Net Amount field
            to 0 and stores the overage figure in the Withhold Surplus field.</p>

        <h3 class="calibre4">Changing or adjusting automated benefit calculations</h3>

        <p class="text">The results of automated adjudication can be changed by changing
            the entries in the not covered, copayment, coinsurance, deductible, and
            reason code fields. However, when more than one exclusion (not covered),
            copay, coinsurance, or deductible benefit rule has been applied to a claim
            detail line, the corresponding Total Not Cov, Total Copay, Total Co-ins,
            and/or Total Deduct fields are protected from entry (grayed), as are the
            corresponding reason code fields (which are filled with asterisks). </p>

        <p class="text">You must use the Patient Liabilities window to view/change
            multiple underlying Copay, Coinsurance, Limits (Not Covered), Deductible,
            and/or Exclusions benefit rules/amounts that constitute the total amounts
            displayed in the Total Not Cov, Total Copay, Total Co-ins, and/or Total
            Deduct fields on the INCLM, Claim Detail window. You must also use the
            Patient Liabilities window to add an "Other Amount." </p>

        <p class="text">The Patient Liabilities window has four focus boxes. The
            first focus box displays claim header member/provider information as displayed
            on the claim header window. The second focus box is a scrollable picklist
            of claim detail lines. The third focus box is a picklist of benefit rule
            data for each benefit rule that has been applied to the claim detail line

            area of Rule Type, Amount, Benefit Rule (ID) and Reason Code data for
            the benefit rule highlighted in the third focus box.</p>

        <p class="text">Only detail records that have not been finalized, but have
            been adjudicated by DIAMOND, are available to change. To make changes
            enter a new Amount and if necessary a new Reason Code. </p>

        <p class="text">If you are changing an automatically determined reason code,
            be aware that your change will not be validated. In addition, accumulations
            under the member’s benefit plan might not be affected by the change, since
            they are added together based on reason codes.</p>

        <p class="text">DIAMOND changes the BRULE ID here to a default value, SYSTEM,
            and the Adj Method second character to "M" (adjudicated manually)
            when you change or add a member liabilities record using this window.</p>

        <p class="text">Patient Liabilities added using this function (rather than

            and Interest Calculations</h2>

        <p class="text">Discount or interest calculations can be automatically applied
            against payable claims and reversed payable claim lines. Interest calculations
            can take into account any unclean days tracked on a claim. A claim may
            be considered unclean if it requires additional substantiating documentation
            from a source outside of your organization and if the missing information
            prevents you from paying the claim timely. </p>

        <p class="text">You can manually apply a discount or interest amount on an
            adjusted claim line. </p>

        <h2 class="calibre3"><a name="INCLM_Authorization_Matching_SUP"></a>Authorization Matching</h2>

        <p class="text">During claims processing, DIAMOND either displays all the
            authorizations for a member, or only those that ‘match’ the claim, depending
            on how certain rules and parameters are set. You also have a choice of
            using data from a selected authorization to populate certain fields on
            the header rather than entering them directly from the claim. </p>

        <h3 class="calibre4">Displaying only authorizations that match the claim</h3>

        <p class="text">If you leave the Auth No. field blank on a new claim and
            the member’s associated LINBS &gt; Auth/Claim Match check box is selected,
            DIAMOND performs authorization/claims matching and displays any "matching"
            authorizations when you move from the claim header window to the claim
            detail window (see Authorization-Claim Links User Documentation for additional
            information). DIAMOND only performs the authorization/claim matching automatically
            the first time you move from the claim header to the claim detail. Subsequently
            (e.g., if you make changes to the claim header and save the header), if
            you want to perform authorization/claims matching you must use Special
            menu command Authorization Match/Waive - options Reapply Match or Reapply
            Match_Waive.</p>

        <p class="text">If the LINBS Auth/Claim Match check box is cleared, then
            DIAMOND displays all of the authorizations for the member, and the user
            selects the correct authorization from this complete list.</p>

        <p class="text">You can delete both claim detail line items and claim header
            records. However, you cannot delete a claim header if it includes any
            detail line items. To delete a claim header that includes detail line
            items, first delete the line items.</p>

        <p class="text">You cannot allow a user to delete claim detail line items
            but not claim header records. You can allow a user to delete both claim
            header and detail line items, or allow the user to delete neither header
            nor detail records. </p>
