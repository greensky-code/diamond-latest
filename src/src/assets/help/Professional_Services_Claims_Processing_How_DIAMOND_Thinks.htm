<h3 class="calibre4">Saving a detail line item</h3>

<p class="text">When you save a claim detail line item, <span class="calibre156">DIAMOND</span>
 compares the Adj Method on the claim detail line to the member’s associated
 group price/adjudication requirement. If the member’s group pricing is
 set to adjudicate (in keyword GRUPD, the <span class="calibre5">Group
 Req</span> list is set to <span class="calibre5">A – Adjud</span>),
 then you must adjudicate the line item before you save it.</p>

<p class="text">For more information, see <a href="Members.chm::/GRUPD_Group_Detail.htm">GRUPD,
 Group Detail</a>. </p>

<p class="text"><a href="Professional_Services_Claims_Processing_How_DIAMOND_Thinks.htm">Top</a></p>

<h2 class="calibre3"><a name="PSCLM_Determining_Claim_Eligibility_MID"></a>Determining Claim
 Eligibility</h2>

<h3 class="calibre4">How DIAMOND determines claim eligibility</h3>

<p class="text">First, DIAMOND uses the service date (<span class="calibre5">Srv
 Date</span> box) on the Professional Services Claims Header window to
 determine eligibility. However, if a through date (<span class="calibre5">Thru
 Date</span> box) is entered, then DIAMOND verifies the member’s eligibility
 based on both dates. A warning displays if the member is ineligible or
 if the member’s eligibility expired before the through date.</p>

<p class="text">If DIAMOND determines the claim is eligible, then it next
 performs checks for Coordination of Benefits (COB), student dependent
 status, and pre-existing conditions. <span class="calibre156">DIAMOND</span>
 displays a warning message if exceptions to eligibility are found. </p>

<p class="text">Also, during adjudication DIAMOND validates that the date
 of service (<span class="calibre5">Date</span> box) falls within
 the date range of one of the member’s eligibility periods. If it does
 not, then the line item is denied. DIAMOND sets the <span class="calibre5">Claim
 Status</span> list to <span class="calibre5">D - Denied</span>,
 sets the <span class="calibre5">Allowed Amt</span> and <span class="calibre5">Total Not Cov</span> boxes to $0.00, and assigns
 the Reason code associated with reason code type ME as the Not Cov Rsn
 code. Reason code type ME (only one is allowed) must exist in keyword
 REASN.</p>

<h3 class="calibre4">What happens when a claim is ineligible</h3>

<p class="text">If the member is ineligible, the claim date of service is
 outside of their eligibility period, then the claim is denied. If the
 eligibility status on the member record is invalid because it does not
 match the valid codes stored in the ELIGSTAT parameter, then the claim
 is held </p>

<p class="text">There are additional methods that can automatically hold
 a claim. For more information, see <a href="Claim_Holds_How_DIAMOND_Thinks_HDT.htm">Claim
 Holds, How DIAMOND Thinks</a>. </p>

<p class="text">You can manually price, adjudicate, or expense a professional
 services claim when a member is outside an eligibility period. However,
 because there is no group/plan information on the claim header DIAMOND
 cannot validate the Group Req. indicator to set the appropriate flag on
 the Pre_Price_Only column, the claim detail line items will not be finalized.</p>

<h3 class="calibre4">Eligibility changes after a claim is processed</h3>

<p class="text"><span class="calibre156">DIAMOND</span> takes
 a "snapshot" of the member’s benefit package/plan/rule(s) to
 be used during the claim adjudication process as soon as the member identification
 is displayed. If the associated benefit package/plan/rules (BENEF, BRULE)
 are changed after the benefits snapshot, the benefit changes are not immediately
 updated on the still open claim header window and <span class="calibre156">DIAMOND</span>
 uses the benefit snapshot (old benefit data) if the claim is adjudicated
 during the session. However, the updated benefit data will display when
 you exit and then re-open the claim. If the claim was adjudicated using
 old benefits (snapshot) data, then on the <span class="calibre5">Special</span>
 menu, point to <span class="calibre5">Pricing and Adjudication</span>,
 and then click <span class="calibre5">Adjudicate Claim</span>
 to re-adjudicate the claim to include the updated (changed) benefit data.</p>

<h2 class="calibre3"><a name="PSCLM_Checking_for_Duplicate_Claims_MID"></a>Checking for Duplicate
 Claims</h2>

<p class="text">Each time a claim is entered, <span class="calibre156">DIAMOND</span>
 automatically checks for duplicate claims based on the duplicate checking
 criteria set up for the line of business associated with the claim. See
 LINBS, Claim Duplicate Rule and Claim Duplicate Check Rules (DUPRL) for
 additional information.</p>

<p class="text"><a href="Professional_Services_Claims_Processing_How_DIAMOND_Thinks.htm">Top</a></p>

<h2 class="calibre3"><a name="PSCLM_About_Pricing_MID"></a>About Pricing </h2>

<p class="text">Each claim detail line may be priced (allowed amount calculation
 only) or fully adjudicated. The <span class="calibre5">Group</span>
 <span class="calibre5">Req</span> list in keyword GRUPD (Group
 Detail) controls whether claims for a group are priced or fully adjudicated.</p>

<p class="text">Pricing of claim detail lines may be based on fee schedules,
 percentages of billed charges, conversion factors, per-diems, diagnostic-related
 groups, or a combination of methods. Claim pricing may be driven by the
 group contract, the provider contract, specific procedure code, or a combination
 of these factors.</p>

<p class="text">You can also manually price a claim detail line by overriding
 the calculated Allowed Amount for either a new claim detail line or any
 existing unfinalized detail line. For more information, see <a href="Pricing.chm::/Manually_Pricing_a_Claim_Detail_Line.htm">Manually
 Pricing a Claim Detail Line</a>.</p>

<h3 class="calibre4">Covering providers</h3>

<p class="text">A covering provider is, usually, a physician who provides
 services in the absence of a PCP to that PCP’s assigned members. When
 a covering provider renders services in this role, he or she may be paid
 according to the PCP’s contract rather than his or her own, or may not,
 depending on the rules of the health plan, the nature of the contracts,
 and health plan practices.</p>

<p class="text">DIAMOND provides a mechanism for recognizing potential covering
 provider situations and allowing the covering provider to be paid according
 to a PCP’s provider contract PROVC record. You can set up covering providers
 with a default action, use the PCP’s contract or use their own contract,
 and this default action can also be overridden manually during claims
 processing.</p>

<p class="text">When you change the default action using the Covering Provider
 Information window:</p>

<ul class="calibre2">

	<li class="kadov-p-cbullet"><p class="bullet"><span class="calibre156">DIAMOND</span>
 performs a provider contract search based on the data entered in the window.</p></li>

	<li class="kadov-p-cbullet"><p class="bullet"><span class="calibre156">DIAMOND</span>
 compares the provider contract data currently existing on the claim against
 the provider contract data derived as a result of the new provider contract
 search.</p></li>

	<li class="kadov-p-cbullet"><p class="bullet"><span class="calibre156">DIAMOND</span>
 takes no action if the contract data in #2 above is the same and <span class="calibre156">DIAMOND</span> displays a "Change
 successful" message.</p></li>

	<li class="kadov-p-cbullet"><p class="bullet">If the contract data in #2
 above is different, <span class="calibre156">DIAMOND</span>
 updates the claim contract data and displays a "Change successful.
 Go to detail window and readjudicate the entire claim" message. </p></li>
</ul>

<p class="text">In this last case, in order to employ the change in pricing
 logic you must use the Special menu command Adjudicate Claim.’</p>

<h3 class="calibre4">Pricing anesthesia claims</h3>

<p class="text">When a Procedure code with a code class of "A"
 (on the PROCD record) or if the <span class="calibre5">Anesthesia</span>
 check box is selected on the Modifier record in keyword MODIF, then the
 Anesthesia Time window will display automatically. The Anesthesia Time
 window may also be selected manually.</p>

<p class="text">To enter time for anesthesia, you may enter either the start
 and end time or the total elapsed time. If you enter start and end times
 DIAMOND calculates the elapsed time as long as the time period is less
 than 24 hours. If greater than 24 hours, you must calculate and enter
 the total elapsed time manually.</p>

<p class="text">For more information, see <a href="Pricing.chm::/Pricing_Anesthesia_Time_How_DIAMOND_Thinks.htm">Pricing
 Anesthesia Time, How DIAMOND Thinks</a>. </p>

<h3 class="calibre4">Allowed greater than billed</h3>

<p class="text">When the Line of Business record is set up, one of the parameters
 is a check box that permits the calculated allowed amount to be greater
 than the entered billed amount. In the absence of this selection, when
 professional services claims associated with this line of business are
 priced, <span class="calibre156">DIAMOND</span>:</p>

<ul class="calibre2">

	<li class="kadov-p-cbullet"><p class="bullet">Prices the claim detail line
 item (determines the allowed amount).</p></li>

	<li class="kadov-p-cbullet"><p class="bullet">Compares the allowed amount
 to the claim detail line billed amount.</p></li>

	<li class="kadov-p-cbullet"><p class="bullet">Lowers the allowed amount
 to the billed amount if the allowed amount is greater than the billed
 amount.</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="text">If this option is selected, when professional services claims
 associated with this line of business are priced, <span class="calibre156">DIAMOND</span>:</p>

<ul class="calibre2">

	<li class="kadov-p-cbullet"><p class="bullet">Prices the claim detail line
 item (determines the allowed amount).</p></li>

	<li class="kadov-p-cbullet"><p class="bullet">Permits the allowed amount
 to be greater than the billed amount.</p></li>

	<li class="kadov-p-cbullet"><p class="bullet">Does not lower the allowed
 amount to the billed amount if the allowed amount is greater than the
 billed amount.</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="text">If the allowed amount is greater than the billed amount and
 the BENEF&gt;Apply Pat Liability To = "Lsr B/A" or "Lsr
 B/A/OA" for the associated (applied) benefit rule, <span class="calibre156">DIAMOND</span>
 displays the difference in the PSCLM&gt;Claim Detail Window &gt; Add Back
 Amt field. See BENEF, Apply Pat Liability To.</p>

<p class="text">Only professional services claims are affected by this check
 box. Institutional claims pricing logic permits the allowed amounts to
 be greater than billed amounts. When this occurs, <span class="calibre156">DIAMOND</span>
 displays the difference in the INCLM&gt;Claim Detail Window &gt; Add Back
 Amt field.</p>

<p class="text">See keyword <a href="Benefits.chm::/BENEF_Benefit_Packages.htm">BENEF
 (Benefit Packages)</a> for information regarding the selection of a benefit
 package’s claim detail line amount type. <span class="calibre156">DIAMOND</span>
 uses the selected amount type selected when it calculates patient liabilities.</p>

<p class="text"><a href="Professional_Services_Claims_Processing_How_DIAMOND_Thinks.htm">Top</a></p>

<h2 class="calibre3"><a name="PSCLM_About_Adjudication_MID"></a>About Adjudication</h2>

<p class="text">Adjudication is the process in which benefit rules, determined
 by a member’s benefit package, are applied to the claim detail line. This
 results in the calculation of deductibles, not-covered amounts, co-payments,
 coinsurance, and exclusions that may reduce the amount paid to the provider.
 When a claim is adjudicated, each claim detail line is both priced (an
 allowed amount is calculated) and adjudicated (benefit rules are applied).
 See Benefit Package Maintenance (BENEF), Benefit Rule Maintenance (BRULE),
 and Group Detail (GRUPD) User Documentation for additional information.</p>

<p class="text">As part of the adjudication process, DIAMOND includes Coordination
 of Benefits (COB) processing when applicable. See Coordination of Benefits
 Overview and related topics for more information on COB.</p>

<h3 class="calibre4">Calculating the Net Amount</h3>

<p class="text">DIAMOND calculates the claim detail line Net Amount differently
 depending on whether the line is automatically or manually adjudicated,
 and whether a COB calculation method applies.</p>

<ol class="calibre20">

	<li class="kadov-p-cstep"><p class="step1">When DIAMOND automatically adjudicates
 a claim line and no COB<span class="calibre5"> </span>applies:</p></li>
</ol>

<p class="stepcont">Net Amount = Allowed Amt - Total Not Cov - Total Copay
 - Total Co-ins - Total Deduct - Pt Liability amounts for Benefit Rule
 type 99 (Other) - Withhold Amt</p>

<p class="stepcont">In some cases, the sum total of the Withhold Amt and
 the patient liabilities (including not covered amounts) may be greater
 than the Allowed Amt. In these situations, rather than placing a negative
 dollar amount in the Net Amount field, DIAMOND sets the Net Amount field
 to 0 and stores the overage figure in the Withhold Surplus field.</p>

<p class="stepcont">The Total Co-ins amount is the sum of all calculated
 coinsurance amounts. DIAMOND calculates each coinsurance amount as the
 benefit rule coinsurance percentage (BRULE Coinsure %) times the claim
 detail line allowed amount <span class="calibre5">net of any
 other benefit rules applied before the current coinsurance rule</span>.
 (You set the processing order for benefit rules in each benefit package.)
 That is, DIAMOND calculates coinsurance on a decreasing total based on
 the application of any prior ordered benefit rules.</p>

<p class="stepcont">Example:</p>

<p class="stepcont">Allowed Amount = 200.00</p>

<p class="stepcont">Benefit Rules in processing order: </p>

<p class="stepcont">1. Copay = 10.00</p>

<p class="stepcont">2. Deductible = 50.00</p>

<p class="stepcont">3. Coinsurance1 = 20%</p>

<p class="stepcont">4. Coinsurance2 = 10%</p>

<p class="stepcont">Coinsurance1 and Coinsurance2 amounts are calculated
 as follows:</p>

<p class="stepcont">200.00 (Allowed Amount) - 10.00 (Copay) = 190.00</p>

<p class="stepcont">190.00 - 50.00 (Deductible) = 140.00</p>

<p class="stepcont">140.00 x 20% (Coinsurance1) = 28.00</p>

<p class="stepcont">140.00 - 28.00 = 112.00</p>

<p class="stepcont">112.00 x 10% (Coinsurance2) = 11.20</p>

<p class="stepcont">112.00 - 11.20 = 100.80</p>

<ol start="2" class="calibre21">

	<li class="kadov-p-cstep"><p class="step1">When DIAMOND automatically adjudicates
 a claim line and<span class="calibre5"> </span>a COB calculation
 method applies:</p></li>
</ol>

<p class="stepcont">DIAMOND performs the specific calculation logic of that
 particular COB calculation method. See <a href="Members.chm::/Coordination_of_Benefits_How_DIAMOND_Thinks.htm">Coordination
 of Benefits – How DIAMOND Thinks</a> for details and examples of COB calculation
 methods.</p>

<p class="stepcont"><span class="calibre5">Note</span> <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}--> <!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->For
 a COB claim that is automatically adjudicated, if the provider on the
 claim has a contract that includes a provider withhold amount, DIAMOND
 does not include this amount in COB and Net Amount calculations. DIAMOND
 does still display the Provider withhold amount on the claim line. </p>

<ol start="3" class="calibre21">

	<li class="kadov-p-cstep"><p class="step1">When you manually adjudicate
 a claim line (that is, after automatic adjudication you manually enter
 or change a total Not Cov, Total Copay, total Co-ins Total Deduct amount
 or Withhold amount), whether or not a COB calculation method applies<span class="calibre5">:</span></p></li>
</ol>

<p class="stepcont">Net Amount = Allowed Amt or OC Allowed (per COB rules)
 - Total Not Cov - Total Copay - - Total Co-ins - Total Deduct - OC Paid
 Amt - Pt Liability amounts for Benefit Rule type 99 (Other) - Withhold
 Amt</p>

<p class="stepcont">In some cases, the sum total of the Withhold Amt and
 the patient liabilities (including not covered amounts) may be greater
 than the Allowed Amt. In these situations, rather than placing a negative
 dollar amount in the Net Amount field, DIAMOND sets the Net Amount field
 to 0 and stores the overage figure in the Withhold Surplus field.</p>

<h3 class="calibre4">Changing or adjusting automated benefit calculations</h3>

<p class="text">Changing the entries in the not covered, copayment, coinsurance,
 deductible, and reason code fields can change the results of automated
 adjudication. However, when more than one exclusion (not covered), copay,
 coinsurance, or deductible benefit rule has been applied to a claim detail
 line, the corresponding <span class="calibre5">Total Not Cov</span>,
 <span class="calibre5">Total Copay</span>, <span class="calibre5">Total
 Co-ins</span>, and/or <span class="calibre5">Total Deduct</span>
 boxes are grayed out and unavailable for entry, as are the corresponding
 reason code fields (which are filled with asterisks). </p>

<p class="text">You must use the Patient Liabilities window to view/change
 multiple underlying Copay, Coinsurance, Limits (Not Covered), Deductible,
 and/or Exclusions benefit rules/amounts that constitute the total amounts
 displayed in the Total Not Cov, Total Copay, Total Co-ins, and/or Total
 Deduct fields on the INCLM, Claim Detail Window. You must also use the
 Patient Liabilities window to add an "Other Amount." </p>

<p class="text">The Patient Liabilities window has four focus boxes. The
 first focus box displays claim header member/provider information as displayed
 on the claim header window. The second focus box is a picklist of claim
 detail line items. The third focus box is a picklist of benefit rule data
 for each benefit rule that has been applied to the claim detail line selected
 in the second focus box. The fourth focus box is a data entry/display
 area of Rule Type, Amount, Benefit Rule (ID) and Reason Code data for
 the benefit rule selected in the third focus box.</p>

<p class="text">Only detail records that have not been finalized, but have
 been adjudicated by <span class="calibre156">DIAMOND</span>,
 are available to change. To make changes enter a new Amount and if necessary
 a new Reason code.</p>

<p class="text">If you are changing an automatically determined reason code,
 be aware that your change will not be validated. In addition, accumulations
 under the member’s benefit plan might not be affected by the change, since
 they are added together based on reason codes.</p>

<p class="text"><span class="calibre156">DIAMOND</span> changes
 the BRULE ID here to a default value, SYSTEM, and the Adj Method second
 character to "M" (adjudicated manually) when you change or add
 a member liabilities record using this window.</p>

<h3 class="calibre4">Adding Patient Liabilities Records</h3>

<p class="text">Patient Liabilities added using this function (rather than

 processing. Use of the non-specific provider and default provider features
 to handle out of plan or one-time providers requires careful setup. See
 Provider Contracts, How DIAMOND Thinks for a complete explanation of this
 feature and its use.</p>

<h3 class="calibre4">Multiple vendor addresses</h3>

<p class="text">In addition to selecting the correct vendor record, DIAMOND
 prompts the user to select the address to which payment should be sent
 in cases where the vendor has multiple address records. A list of valid
 addresses is displayed, and the user picks from this list.</p>

<h3 class="calibre4">Provider contract data</h3>

<p class="text">Keyword APUPD (Accounts Payable Update) creates A/P claims
 records and selects either medical (claims) or capitation records for
 payment. At the same time the originating records in claims and capitation
 are finalized. As part of the finalization of the original claims records
 a transaction number is generated and appropriate general ledger accounts
 are updated. Once claim detail lines are finalized using APUPD, they cannot
 be changed; however, finalized claim detail lines can be adjusted or reversed
 (as can unfinalized lines). </p>

<p class="text">Use keyword PROVC (Provider Contracts) to set up the printing
 of Remittance Advices (RAs) for a specific provider. Use keyword LINBS

<p class="text">You can access/override the RA and EOB printing defaults
 for a specific claim using the <span class="calibre5">Payment
 Detail</span> command on the <span class="calibre5">Special</span>
 menu. RA and EOB printing status codes are also displayed on accounts
 payable records (ACPAY, RA/EOB Print Flag).</p>
