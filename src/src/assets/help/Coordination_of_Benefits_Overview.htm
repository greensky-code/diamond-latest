        <h4 class="calibre1">Coordination of Benefits Overview</h4>

        <p class="body-text">The following provides an overview of DIAMOND Coordination
            of Benefits processing. You can use DIAMOND Coordination of Benefits functionality
            for processing institutional, professional services, and dental claims.
            For more detailed information on COB, see Member COB History (COBHS) and
            Coordination of Benefits – How DIAMOND Thinks User Documentation.</p>

        <p class="doc-level">Definition of Coordination of Benefits (COB)</p>

        <p class="body-text">Coordination of Benefits (COB) is the process by which
            medical insurance benefits of multiple coverages are coordinated for a
            single claim. DIAMOND COB functionality allows you to coordinate additional
            coverage with the coverage on the DIAMOND claim to adjust the net amount
            paid by DIAMOND. The additional coverage could be another DIAMOND coverage
            (Dual DIAMOND) or it could be from a carrier external to DIAMOND, as shown
            in the following examples. In DIAMOND COB functionality, DIAMOND is the
            secondary payer when the additional coverage is primary.</p>

        <p class="body-text">Any carrier for whom you want to coordinate benefits
            or from whom you have received an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) or Explanation
            of Medicare Benefits (EOMB) is referred to in DIAMOND as an "Other
            Carrier", whether the carrier is internal or external to DIAMOND.</p>

        <p class="body-text">In DIAMOND, several different COB calculation methods
            are available. You can also hold or deny claims based on COB criteria
            and track COB history. In addition, you can define rules to determine
            the COB application of benefits order (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary or
            Other) for each individual COB History record.</p>

        <p class="doc-level">Adding Carriers External to DIAMOND</p>

        <p class="body-text">To add health insurance carriers external to DIAMOND
            who provide coverage to members enrolled in the DIAMOND health plan, use
            DIAMOND’s Carrier function. For more information, see Carrier (CARCD)
            User Documentation.</p>

        <p class="doc-level">Adding Coordination of Benefits Coverage Records</p>

        <p class="body-text">To document alternate or supplemental coverage for a
            member or family unit, use the Member COB History (COBHS) function. The
            carrier on the COBHS record is an "Other Carrier".</p>

        <p class="body-text">See COBHS User Documentation for more information.</p>

        <p class="doc-level">Automatically Assigning COB Order</p>

        <p class="body-text">You can have DIAMOND automatically assign a COB Order
            (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary or Other) to a COB History record. The COB
            Order does not impact the COB calculations used to adjust the Net Amount
            during claims adjudication. However, COB Order can be used as a determinant
            in DIAMOND’s table driven COB hold/deny rules described below and COB
            Order must equal Primary in order for system parameter COBCLAIMACTN actions
            to be applied to a claim as described below.</p>

        <p class="doc-level">Holding and Denying Claims based on COB</p>

        <p class="body-text">There are two ways to hold or deny claim detail lines
            (and generate warnings) based on COB:</p>

        <ul class="calibre15">

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">COBCLAIMACTN
                parameter</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">COB Hold/Deny
                rules</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p class="doc-level1">COBCLAIMACTN Parameter</p>

        <p class="body-text">If you enter COB information in COBHS for a member who
            has primary coverage with another carrier (COBHS field COB Order = Primary),
            each time a claim is entered for that member and the primary date of service
            matches the effective period of the COB History record, you can have DIAMOND:</p>

        <ul class="calibre15">

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">Display a
                COB warning only</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">Display a
                COB warning, automatically hold the claim and assign a selected hold reason</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">Display a
                COB warning, automatically deny the claim and assign a selected deny reason</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p class="body-text">You use a parameter record (PARAM &gt; COBCLAIMACTN)
            to specify what action DIAMOND will take on claims submitted from members
            with other primary coverage. The action you specify on this parameter
            will be taken on claims entered with primary dates of service within the
            member’s COBHS Coverage Effective Date and the COBHS Coverage Term Date.</p>

        <p class="doc-level1">COB Hold/Deny Rules</p>

        <p class="body-text">You define COB Hold and Deny rules using the function
            COB Hold /Deny Determinants (COBHD). Selected determinants are available
            from the Institutional, Professional Services, or Dental claim header
            (depending on claim type), COB History, Group Detail, and Member Master
            tables. </p>

        <p class="body-text">DIAMOND applies COB Hold/Deny rules when you enter or
            modify and save an institutional, professional services, or dental claim
            header. COB Hold/Deny processing occurs regardless of whether a COBHS
            record exists for the member. If a matching rule is found, DIAMOND applies
            the Action (Hold or Deny) and the Reason Code from the matching COB Hold/Deny
            rule to all claim detail lines. COB Hold/Deny processing supercedes system
            parameter COBCLAIMACTN.</p>

        <p class="doc-level">Using Automatic vs. Manual Coordination of Benefits</p>

        <p class="body-text">You can automatically apply COB calculation during online
            claims adjudication using a COB calculation method as explained below.</p>

        <p class="body-text">You can also manually apply COB to a claim line by simply
            entering an Other Carrier Paid Amount (PSCLM/INCLM/DNCLM detail – OC Pd
            Amt). DIAMOND subtracts the OC Pd Amt from the DIAMOND calculated Net
            Amount and displays the result as the adjusted Net Amount.</p>

        <p class="doc-level">COB Calculation Methods</p>

        <p class="body-text">You can have DIAMOND automatically calculate COB for
            each claim line using a COB calculation method. Several different COB
            calculation methods are available. Each COB calculation method has its
            own specific fixed automatic claims adjudication logic. </p>

        <p class="body-text">You select COB calculation methods for an employer group
            for a specific effective period on the Group Detail (GRUPD) record. You
            can establish the same or different COB calculation methods for institutional,
            professional services, and dental claims.</p>

        <p class="body-text">For more information, see Using COB Calculation Methods
            user documentation.</p>

        <p class="doc-level">Claim Header Field EOB Indicator</p>

        <p class="body-text">You may receive a commercial carrier EOB (Explanation
            of Benefits) or Medicare EOMB (Explanation of Medicare Benefits) for a
            DIAMOND claim.</p>

        <p class="tip-note-warning">Note</p>

        <p class="body-text">You must select EOB or EOMB here in order to activate
            the OC Allowed field on the claim detail.</p>

        <p class="body-text">When you select EOB or EOMB, DIAMOND allows you to select
            a matching COB History record. When you select a matching record, DIAMOND
            populates the claim header field OC Carrier Code (Other Carrier - Carrier
            Code) with the COBHS Carrier and makes the OC Allowed field available
            for input on all claim detail lines.</p>

        <p class="doc-level">Other DIAMOND COB Functionality</p>

        <ul class="calibre15">

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">For Medicare
                claims, you can limit total payment to the Medicare allowed amount</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">You can exclude
                capitated claims from COB (GRUPD)</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">When you
                use a COB calculation method of Non-Duplication of Benefits or Integration
                of Benefits, you can define a default Commercial COB Allowed Amount rule
                on each provider contract (PROVC) record. DIAMOND uses the Commercial
                COB Allowed Amount rule in automatic claims adjudication. A Commercial
                COB Allowed Amount rule specifies whether DIAMOND uses the DIAMOND Allowed
                Amount or the lesser of the DIAMOND Allowed Amount or Other Carrier Allowed
                Amount. This value is defaulted to each corresponding claim when one of
                these two calculation methods applies. It may be manually overridden.
                If you do not select a default Commercial COB Allowed Amount rule in PROVC,
                DIAMOND uses the DIAMOND Allowed Amount for Non-Duplication of Benefits
                and Integration of Benefits calculations.</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">You can view
                a claim’s COB History information (associated COBHS record you selected)

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">You can use
                the system parameter COBAUTHACTN to activate a COB warning message to

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">You can specify
                a Dependent Determination Rule on GRUPD and on the individual COBHS record.</p></li>

            <li class="kadov-p-cbullet-list-h"><p class="bullet-list-h">You can record
                COB verification information from the member or the other carrier in MEMBR

        </ul>

        <p class="doc-level">Claims Batch (EDI) and Claims API – COB Restrictions,

                not apply COB calculation methods to Claims Batch and Claims API processing.
                DIAMOND applies COB calculation methods for online processing only. If
                DIAMOND determines that a claim submitted via Claims Batch or Claims API
                is a potential COB claim, DIAMOND holds or denies the claim based on the
                parameter COBCLAIMACTN.</p></li>
